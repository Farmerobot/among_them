# Engineering Conventions

## Conventions
> When writing code, it is important to follow conventions to ensure that the code is readable and maintainable. This document outlines the conventions that should be followed when writing code for the project.

- Write simple verbose code over terse dense code.
- If a function does not have a corresponding test, mention it.


**Code Style:**

* **Naming:**
    * Use descriptive and consistent naming for variables, functions, classes, and modules.
* **Comments:**
    * Use clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
    * Avoid redundant comments that simply restate the code.

**Testing:**

* **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all functions and classes to ensure their correctness.
* **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different components of the system.
* **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage to ensure that all code paths are tested.

**Code Organization:**

* **Modules:** Organize code into logical modules to improve maintainability.
* **Classes:** Use classes to encapsulate data and behavior.
* **Functions:** Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes.


Remember, the goal of conventions is to make this code more readable, maintainable, and collaborative.
