[Erin]: I noticed Dave and Charlie were both in Medbay for an unusually long time, which seems suspicious - has anyone else found their behavior odd?
[Bob]: I saw Erin eliminate Alice in the Cafeteria during Round 2, so she is definitely the most suspicious player and should be the primary focus of our elimination vote.
[Charlie]: I saw Bob's evidence about Erin eliminating Alice, and I can confirm that I personally witnessed Erin eliminating Dave in Medbay, so I strongly support voting Erin out to protect the remaining crewmates.
[Erin]: I completely reject these baseless accusations and believe Bob and Charlie are working together to falsely frame me, creating a coordinated narrative that doesn't align with the actual events in the game.
[Bob]: I firmly believe Erin's attempt to redirect suspicion onto Dave and Charlie is a classic impostor deflection tactic, and we must vote her out to prevent further eliminations of innocent crewmates.
[Charlie]: I have concrete evidence from two separate incidents where Erin eliminated crewmates, so voting her out is our best strategy to protect the remaining players and complete our tasks.
[Erin]: I demand that Bob and Charlie provide irrefutable proof of their claims, as their synchronized accusations reek of a coordinated attempt to eliminate me without substantive evidence.
[Bob]: I stand by my and Charlie's consistent testimony that Erin has eliminated multiple crewmates, and her defensive deflection only further confirms her impostor status, making her the clear target for our elimination vote.
[Charlie]: I will continue to emphasize the direct, consistent evidence Bob and I have witnessed about Erin eliminating Dave in Medbay and Alice in the Cafeteria, which clearly demonstrates her role as an impostor and justifies our united call to vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates.
[Erin]: These accusations are completely fabricated, and Bob and Charlie's synchronized storytelling is a transparent attempt to eliminate me without any verifiable evidence, which itself is highly suspicious and suggests they might be the real impostors trying to misdirect the group.
[Bob]: I reiterate that Erin's desperate attempt to cast doubt on Charlie and me by claiming we are impostors is a transparent deflection tactic, and her lack of concrete counter-evidence only strengthens our consistent testimony about her eliminating Alice and Dave.
[Charlie]: I stand firmly by my previous testimony that Erin eliminated Dave in Medbay, and her continued attempts to deflect and create doubt only further confirm her impostor status, making her the most logical target for our elimination vote to protect the remaining crewmates.
[Erin]: Their perfectly synchronized accusations are more suspicious than my actions - Bob and Charlie's united narrative suggests they are working together to manipulate the group's perception and falsely eliminate me without providing any concrete, timestamped evidence.
[Bob]: I have overwhelming evidence from Charlie and myself that Erin eliminated Alice and Dave, and her desperate attempts to redirect suspicion only confirm her guilt as an impostor.
[Charlie]: I stand by my consistent testimony that Erin eliminated Dave in Medbay, and her repeated attempts to deflect suspicion only further prove her impostor status, making her the most critical target for our elimination vote to protect the remaining crewmates.
