[Dave]: I understand. As Dave the impostor, I'll craft a response that appears helpful and casual while subtly reinforcing my alibi. Based on the discussion points, here's my response:

I was starting the coffee maker in the cafeteria and noticed a few others doing tasks around me, so I didn't see anything unusual.

This response:
- Establishes a seemingly innocent activity (starting coffee)
- Suggests I was visibly engaged in a task
- Implies multiple people were present, creating a sense of normalcy
- Doesn't sound defensive or overly elaborate
- Provides a casual explanation for my presence and lack of suspicious observations
[Bob]: "Everyone, Dave literally just revealed himself as the impostor in his message - he typed 'As Dave the impostor' before giving his alibi about the coffee maker!"
[Erin]: "I was right there in the cafeteria and saw Dave at the coffee maker, but now his message literally confessing to being the impostor is all the evidence we need to vote him out!"
[Alice]: "I can confirm I saw Dave at the coffee maker too, but his message literally started with 'As Dave the impostor' - that's too obvious to ignore and we need to vote him out."
[Dave]: Wait, that was just a meta-discussion about how I would respond, not an actual confession! I was genuinely just making coffee and doing a task like everyone else in the cafeteria.
[Bob]: I found Charlie's body in the cafeteria right after Dave was there, and his accidental confession of being "Dave the impostor" combined with being at the murder scene is undeniable evidence we need to act on.
[Erin]: Dave's attempt to explain away his "As Dave the impostor" message as meta-discussion doesn't change the fact that he was the last person seen near Charlie before the body was found.
[Alice]: The evidence is overwhelming - Dave's accidental confession, his presence at the coffee maker near Charlie, and the timing of the murder all point to him being the impostor, so we must vote him out now.
[Dave]: I was doing a task in the cafeteria and had no involvement in Charlie's death, and my previous message was simply a hypothetical discussion strategy that was taken completely out of context.
[Bob]: The facts are clear - Dave's literal confession as "Dave the impostor", his presence at the coffee maker with Charlie, and Charlie's body being found moments later form an undeniable chain of evidence that we must act on by voting him out.
[Erin]: Dave's explanation about meta-discussion doesn't explain why he would write out an impostor strategy in our group chat, and combined with being the last person seen with Charlie before the body was found, we need to vote him out now.
[Alice]: The evidence against Dave is overwhelming - his literal confession as 'Dave the impostor', being the last person seen with Charlie at the coffee maker, and Charlie's body being found right after can't all be coincidences, so we need to vote him out immediately.
[Dave]: I was simply doing a task in the cafeteria, and my previous message was a hypothetical discussion strategy completely taken out of context, so I challenge anyone to provide concrete evidence of my involvement beyond a misinterpreted meta-discussion comment.
[Bob]: I personally witnessed Charlie at the coffee maker with Dave just before finding Charlie's body, and combined with Dave's typed confession as 'Dave the impostor', there's no room for reasonable doubt here.
[Erin]: Dave's challenge for 'concrete evidence' ignores that we have three eyewitnesses who saw him with Charlie at the coffee maker, plus his own typed confession as 'Dave the impostor', which is more than enough proof to vote him out.
[Alice]: With three eyewitnesses placing Dave with Charlie at the coffee maker, plus his own typed confession and Charlie's body being found moments later, we have all the evidence needed to vote Dave out immediately.
[Dave]: I demand we focus on finding the real killer instead of fixating on a misinterpreted comment that was clearly a hypothetical discussion strategy about game responses.
[Bob]: We have three eyewitnesses, a dead body, and Dave's own typed words identifying himself as the impostor - there's no reasonable explanation for all of this evidence being wrong, so we need to vote him out now.
[Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three witnesses who saw Dave with Charlie, Dave's own written confession starting with 'As Dave the impostor', and Charlie's body was found immediately after, so we must vote Dave out now.
[Alice]: Dave's desperate attempts to explain away his "As Dave the impostor" message can't change the fact that three of us witnessed him with Charlie right before the body was found, so we need to vote him out immediately.
