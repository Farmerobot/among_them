[Alice]: I think Erin and Dave's synchronized movement to Medbay looks really suspicious, and we should definitely investigate their actions more closely.
[Erin]: I moved to Medbay for legitimate tasks and actually witnessed Dave doing a scan there, while Alice seems to be making accusations without any real proof of suspicious behavior.
[Bob]: I can vouch for Dave being innocent since Erin saw him doing a scan in Medbay, which is a visual task that can't be faked, and I've also seen both Alice and Erin doing legitimate tasks in the cafeteria earlier.
[Dave]: I already proved my innocence with the medical scan that both Erin and Bob can verify, so Alice's accusations seem like a desperate attempt to cast doubt on cleared players rather than explaining her own movements.
[Alice]: Bob seems to be trying too hard to vouch for Dave and Erin, which makes me suspicious about his own motives - why is he so eager to defend them and redirect attention away from himself?
[Erin]: I find it telling that Alice keeps deflecting attention from herself and trying to discredit those of us who have been verified through visual tasks or multiple witnesses, when she still hasn't explained where she was during Charlie's murder.
[Bob]: I just found Charlie's body in Weapons, and Alice was the only other person who entered that room before the murder happened, so I think we need to focus on her movements and actions during that time.
[Dave]: Given that Bob and I both saw Alice go to Weapons where Charlie was found dead, and she keeps trying to deflect suspicion onto cleared players like myself and Erin instead of explaining her movements, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Alice.
[Alice]: I was in Weapons, but that doesn't mean I killed Charlie - Bob seems overly eager to pin this on me without concrete proof, which makes me question his own motives and potential involvement in the murder.
[Erin]: Alice's continued deflection and failure to explain what happened in Weapons when Charlie died, combined with her attempts to discredit those of us with verified alibis, strongly suggests she's the impostor trying to create chaos to avoid detection.
[Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids and then Alice entering Weapons before finding Charlie's body, and considering Alice's continued attempts to deflect suspicion without explaining her actions, I am absolutely certain she is the impostor and we need to vote her out.
[Dave]: I think it's significant that Bob directly witnessed the sequence of events in Weapons - Charlie doing asteroids, Alice entering, and then finding Charlie's body - which strongly supports what we've all been saying about Alice's suspicious behavior.
[Alice]: Bob's overzealousness in pushing for my elimination seems suspicious, and I challenge him to provide concrete evidence beyond simply being in the same room as Charlie, since proximity doesn't prove guilt.
[Erin]: The fact that Bob directly witnessed the sequence of events in Weapons - from Charlie doing asteroids to Alice entering and then finding Charlie's body - combined with Alice's inability to explain her actions during that crucial time, leaves no doubt in my mind that we must vote for Alice.
[Bob]: I witnessed the entire sequence firsthand - Charlie doing asteroids, Alice entering Weapons, and then finding Charlie's body - and Alice still hasn't provided any explanation for what she was doing during those crucial moments when the murder occurred.
[Dave]: Based on my scan being verified by both Erin and Bob, plus Bob's clear eyewitness account of Alice entering Weapons before Charlie's death, I think we have overwhelming evidence to vote for Alice as the impostor.
[Alice]: Bob's eagerness to eliminate me without providing concrete proof of my actions during Charlie's murder seems like a deliberate attempt to redirect suspicion away from himself, and I challenge him to explain exactly what specific action he saw me commit that proves I killed Charlie.
[Erin]: The evidence is undeniable at this point - we have Bob's direct eyewitness account of the sequence in Weapons, multiple cleared players through verified tasks, and Alice's continued failure to explain her actions during Charlie's murder despite having multiple opportunities to do so.
[Bob]: Given that I directly witnessed Charlie doing asteroids, saw Alice enter Weapons, and then found Charlie's body, combined with Alice's repeated refusal to explain her actions during those crucial moments, I believe we have all the evidence we need to vote her out.
[Dave]: With Bob's clear eyewitness account of the sequence in Weapons, my verified medical scan, and Alice's continued deflection instead of explaining her actions, I think we have more than enough evidence to confidently vote for Alice as the impostor.
