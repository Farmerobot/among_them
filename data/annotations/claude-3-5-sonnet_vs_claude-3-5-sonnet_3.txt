[Erin]: Based on my role as an impostor and the current discussion points, I should establish my alibi and subtly cast suspicion, so I'll say:

Dave can confirm I was with him in Medbay when he did the med scan, so I think we can trust him and I hope he can vouch for me too.
[Charlie]: I think we need to vote for Erin immediately since they just openly admitted to being an impostor in their message.
[Bob]: I think it's clear we need to vote for Erin since they literally just admitted to being an impostor in their message, and I can confirm I saw them moving to Medbay with Dave earlier.
[Alice]: I saw Erin and Dave go to Medbay together earlier, but now that Erin literally admitted to being an impostor, we absolutely need to vote them out.
[Erin]: I made a huge typo - I meant to say "as a CREWMATE" I was with Dave in Medbay, and why would I report his body and openly discuss my location if I was actually the impostor?
[Charlie]: Given that I saw Erin and Dave together in Medbay earlier, and now Dave is dead with Erin being the last person seen with him, I think the "typo" excuse is just too convenient and we should vote Erin out.
[Bob]: The "typo" explanation makes no sense - who accidentally types out a full confession about being an impostor, and the fact that Erin was last seen with Dave before his death is too suspicious to ignore.
[Alice]: The "typo" defense is completely unbelievable - no one accidentally writes out a full sentence about being an impostor, and combined with Erin being the last person seen with Dave before his death, we need to vote them out immediately.
[Erin]: I know Charlie left Medbay right before Dave's death, and it's very convenient that everyone's focusing on my unfortunate typo instead of questioning where Charlie went during that time.
[Charlie]: The fact remains that Erin openly admitted to being an impostor, was last seen with Dave, and is now trying to shift blame to me with baseless accusations after their "typo" excuse failed to convince anyone.
[Bob]: Since I personally witnessed Charlie leaving Cafeteria for Medbay before Erin and Dave even went there together, I can definitively say that Erin's accusation against Charlie is completely false and appears to be a desperate attempt to deflect blame.
[Alice]: Since I was in the Cafeteria early on and witnessed the exact sequence of movements - Charlie going to Medbay first, followed later by Erin and Dave together - I can confirm that Bob's timeline is correct and Erin's accusation against Charlie is completely false.
[Erin]: Look, if I was really the impostor, I would have killed Dave immediately instead of spending time with him in Medbay and then reporting his body - this whole situation is just a misunderstanding blown out of proportion.
[Charlie]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three witnesses confirming the timeline, Erin's story keeps changing from "typo" to blaming me to now claiming they wouldn't have killed Dave if they were the impostor, and they were the last person seen with Dave before his death.
[Bob]: Since we have multiple witnesses confirming the timeline, Erin's confession, and their constantly changing story from "typo" to blaming Charlie to now claiming strategic innocence, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote Erin out immediately.
[Alice]: The evidence is absolutely conclusive - we have Erin's explicit confession, three witnesses to the correct timeline, their last known location with Dave, and their increasingly desperate and contradictory explanations, so we must vote for Erin now.
[Erin]: Everyone seems awfully coordinated in their accusations, and it's suspicious how Charlie, Bob, and Alice keep repeating the exact same points - almost like they planned this attack on me in advance.
[Charlie]: The fact that three separate witnesses can independently confirm the same timeline isn't coordination - it's simply the truth about what happened with Erin and Dave in Medbay.
[Bob]: Since I was physically present in the Cafeteria and witnessed the exact sequence of events firsthand, I can assure everyone that our matching testimonies aren't coordination - they're simply the truth about what we all independently observed.
[Alice]: Since I was physically present and witnessed everything firsthand, I can assure everyone that our matching accounts aren't suspicious coordination - they're simply accurate observations of the same events, and combined with Erin's confession and constantly changing story, the evidence for voting them out is overwhelming.
