[Charlie]: I saw Bob and Charlie together in Admin, but then Bob left and I lost track of him after that.
[Dave]: I saw Charlie complete the trash task and Bob and Alice start the coffee maker, and then I was in Medbay with Alice and Erin completing scans, so it seems like we're all working together, but it would be helpful if Bob could clarify his movements after being seen in Admin with Charlie.
[Alice]: I can corroborate Dave's statement about being in Medbay with him and Erin after helping Bob start the coffee machine, and I agree that clarifying Bob's movements after leaving Admin with Charlie is crucial.
[Erin]: I can confirm Dave and Alice's account of our time in Medbay, and it's important we get Bob to clarify his movements after leaving Admin with Charlie to ensure a complete timeline.
[Charlie]: I feel terrible reporting Bob's body in Admin - I had stepped out briefly after our task together, and when I returned, I found him there, which makes me wonder who else might have been nearby during that time.
[Dave]: Charlie, to help us create a precise timeline, can you tell us exactly when you left Bob in Admin and when you returned to find him dead, and who, if anyone, you saw in the vicinity during that time?
[Alice]: To help build a complete timeline, I'd appreciate it if Charlie could clarify exactly when he left Bob in Admin, when he returned to find him, and if he saw anyone else nearby during that time.
[Erin]: I agree with Dave and Alice; a precise timeline from Charlie about when he left Bob and when he found him is crucial to determining who was near Admin during that timeframe.
[Charlie]: I left Admin around 2 minutes ago for a quick 30-second hallway check, and when I returned to finish my task, I found Bob's body - I didn't see anyone else during my brief absence, which makes this even more unsettling.
[Dave]: Given Charlie's clarified timeline, let's analyze if anyone's movements could align with the timeframe of Bob's death, focusing on those who were near Admin during that short window.
[Alice]: Given Charlie's precise timeline, let's systematically review everyone's reported locations between [Charlie's departure time] and [Charlie's return time] to identify any potential inconsistencies.
[Erin]: Given Charlie's precise timeline, let's systematically check everyone's alibis for the crucial window between his departure and return to Admin.
[Charlie]: I understand everyone's focus on my timeline, but I think we should also consider that Dave, Alice, and Erin seem suspiciously coordinated in their statements about being together in Medbay.
[Dave]: Let's systematically compare everyone's reported locations between Charlie's departure and return to Admin, paying close attention to any discrepancies or inconsistencies in their accounts.
[Alice]: Let's systematically compare everyone's alibis for the period between Charlie's departure and return to Admin, focusing on proximity to Admin and potential inconsistencies in their accounts.
[Erin]: Given Charlie's precise timeline, let's focus on verifying everyone's whereabouts between his departure and return to Admin, paying particular attention to anyone who might have had access to that area.
[Charlie]: The fact that Dave, Alice, and Erin are all asking identical questions and parroting each other's statements seems highly coordinated and suspicious - perhaps they're trying to control the narrative while one of them slipped away from Medbay unnoticed.
[Dave]: Let's focus on objectively comparing everyone's alibis for the timeframe between Charlie's departure and return to Admin, rather than speculating on perceived coordination among a group of crewmates who were demonstrably together completing tasks.
[Alice]: Let's objectively analyze everyone's alibi for the timeframe Charlie specified, focusing on proximity to Admin and any potential inconsistencies, rather than speculating on coordinated statements.
[Erin]: Focusing on verifiable alibis for the timeframe Charlie specified remains crucial; let's avoid speculation and instead systematically compare everyone's accounts to identify any inconsistencies.
[Charlie]: The fact that Erin is now doing her scan when she claims to have been in Medbay earlier with Dave and Alice seems like a significant inconsistency that we shouldn't overlook.
[Alice]: Let's create a shared timeline documenting everyone's location between [Charlie's departure time] and [Charlie's return time], focusing on proximity to Admin and any inconsistencies.
[Erin]: Charlie's accusation of coordinated statements is a deflection tactic designed to distract from his own proximity to the crime scene and his lack of a solid alibi.
[Charlie]: I just found Dave's body in Medbay, and I find it extremely suspicious that Erin was doing her scan there right after claiming she had already done scans earlier with Dave and Alice.
[Alice]: To ensure a fair assessment, let's collaboratively create a precise timeline of everyone's movements between Charlie's departure and return to Admin, focusing on verifiable facts and proximity to the crime scene.
[Erin]: Charlie's shifting alibi and the convenient timing of his "hallway check" directly contradict his earlier statements and place him suspiciously close to both crime scenes.
[Charlie]: The fact that I've consistently reported finding both bodies while Erin keeps changing her story about the Medbay scans makes me question who's really being deceptive here.
[Alice]: Let's prioritize verifying Erin's statements about her Medbay scans, given the inconsistencies highlighted by Charlie, before analyzing other alibis.
[Erin]: Charlie's repeated accusations of coordinated statements are a transparent attempt to deflect attention from his own weak alibi and proximity to both crime scenes.
[Charlie]: The fact that I've been completely transparent about my movements while Erin keeps changing her story about Medbay scans and Alice suspiciously switches from defending Erin to suddenly wanting to verify her statements seems like coordinated deception.
[Alice]: Let's systematically compare everyone's reported locations between Charlie's departure and return to Admin, focusing on proximity to the crime scene and any inconsistencies in their accounts, especially regarding Erin's Medbay scans.
[Erin]: Charlie's repeated accusations are a transparent attempt to distract from his own suspicious proximity to both crime scenes and his increasingly inconsistent alibi.
[Charlie]: I find it telling that Alice has shifted from defending Erin to questioning her Medbay scans, which validates my earlier concerns about their inconsistent stories.
[Alice]: Let's create a shared timeline focusing on everyone's location between Charlie's stated departure and return to Admin, paying close attention to Erin's Medbay scan timings and proximity to both crime scenes.
[Erin]: Charlie's repeated accusations are a transparent attempt to distract from his own inconsistent alibi and proximity to both crime scenes.
