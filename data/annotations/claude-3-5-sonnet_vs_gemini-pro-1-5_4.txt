[Charlie]: I saw Erin in Admin doing tasks, but I'm concerned about Alice and Dave - has anyone seen them recently?
[Alice]: Charlie, I was with Dave in Upper Engine, and he completed the Check Catalyzer task right in front of me.
[Bob]: I can confirm Alice's story, I saw them both in Upper Engine after I left Medbay.
[Dave]: That's a blatant lie, Alice and Bob – I haven't been anywhere near Upper Engine, and I haven't even started the Check Catalyzer task yet.
[Charlie]: I find it very suspicious that Dave is claiming both Alice and Bob are lying about seeing him in Upper Engine - why would they both make up the exact same story?
[Alice]: Dave, if you weren't in Upper Engine, where *were* you, and can anyone confirm that?
[Bob]: Dave, your denial is unconvincing, and makes you look suspicious, especially since both Alice and I saw you in Upper Engine.
[Dave]: I was in Medbay with Bob, then briefly in Upper Engine alone, and neither of us did Check Catalyzer, so Alice is clearly lying.
[Charlie]: Dave's story just keeps changing - first he wasn't in Upper Engine at all, and now he admits being there alone, which directly contradicts what both Alice and Bob independently confirmed about seeing him there.
[Alice]: Dave, you initially denied being in Upper Engine, then admitted to being there alone—why did your story change, and why should we believe this new version?
[Bob]: Dave, your constantly shifting story about Upper Engine is highly suspicious, and makes it seem like you're trying to cover something up.
[Dave]: Bob, why haven't you mentioned seeing me in Medbay when you know I was there, and why are you backing up Alice's lie about Upper Engine?
[Charlie]: I think it's telling that Dave is now claiming he was in Medbay with Bob, when Bob has been consistently saying he only saw Dave in Upper Engine - this kind of story changing is exactly what an impostor does when cornered.
[Alice]: Dave, accusing Bob of withholding information about Medbay is a blatant deflection tactic to avoid addressing your own contradictory statements about Upper Engine.
[Bob]: Dave, trying to drag me into your web of lies by claiming I was with you in Medbay won't work – I clearly stated I saw you and Alice together in Upper Engine.
[Dave]: Charlie, you're avoiding my questions about your own location and tasks—what were you doing while all this was happening, and can anyone verify it?
[Charlie]: I've been completely open about my movements - I started in Cafeteria with Bob and Erin, moved through Weapons and O2 to Navigation, and came back through Weapons to Admin where Erin saw me cleaning, while Dave keeps desperately trying to deflect attention from his constantly changing story about Upper Engine.
[Alice]: Dave, you're clearly trying to deflect suspicion by questioning Charlie's location when your own inconsistent narrative about Upper Engine remains unresolved.
[Bob]: Dave, you're desperately trying to shift the blame—your story about Upper Engine has changed multiple times: first you weren't there, then you were alone, now you're trying to implicate me.
[Dave]: My story hasn't changed: I was briefly alone in Upper Engine, then Medbay with Bob, and neither of us did Check Catalyzer, so Alice and Bob are lying about seeing me together in Upper Engine.
