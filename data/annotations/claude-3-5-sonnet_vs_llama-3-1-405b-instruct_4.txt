[Charlie]: Based on the discussion points and my role as an impostor, I want to establish credibility while staying under the radar. I'll emphasize my visibility and connection to other players:

"I can vouch that I was in Medbay with Dave and Bob for most of the round, and we were all doing our tasks normally."
[Alice]: I'd like to clarify Charlie's statement, as I was also in Medbay, and I noticed that Erin was with us, but Charlie didn't mention them - can you explain why you left Erin out of your account, Charlie?
[Erin]: I appreciate Alice bringing up Charlie's incomplete account of the Medbay interactions, and I'd like to know why Charlie didn't mention me in their initial statement, considering we were in the same room together.
[Bob]: I'd like to add to Alice's question and Erin's concern about Charlie's statement, Charlie, you mentioned being in Medbay with Dave and me, but you left out Erin, who was also with us, can you clarify why you didn't include Erin in your initial statement?
[Charlie]: I apologize for any confusion - I was focused on mentioning Dave and Bob since they were doing visible tasks like the scan and diagnostics, but you're right that Erin was there too before heading to Upper Engine.
[Alice]: I still find it suspicious that Charlie didn't mention Erin initially and only apologized after being questioned by multiple players, and I'd like to hear from Charlie about their exact actions after leaving Medbay, including any rooms they visited before finding Dave's body.
[Erin]: I'd like to reiterate Alice's request and ask Charlie to provide a detailed account of their actions after leaving Medbay, including the specific rooms they visited and any interactions they had with other players before discovering Dave's body.
[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous question and emphasize the importance of Charlie providing a clear, step-by-step explanation of their movements after leaving Medbay, including any rooms they visited and interactions they had with other players before finding Dave's body.
[Charlie]: I need to address the confusion - I never actually found Dave's body, and I'm still in Medbay where I last saw him doing his scan, so I'm not sure why everyone keeps asking about my movements after leaving or finding a body.
[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's latest statement about never leaving Medbay and not finding Dave's body raises even more questions, as it contradicts their earlier implication of having left Medbay and discovered something, and I think it's essential we get a clear and consistent account from Charlie before we proceed.
[Erin]: I find it suspicious that Charlie initially implied they left Medbay and discovered something, but now claims they never left Medbay and didn't find Dave's body, and I think we need a thorough explanation from Charlie to clarify these inconsistencies before we can trust their statements.
[Bob]: I think it's time for Charlie to provide a clear and detailed explanation of their entire experience in Medbay, including their interactions with Dave, Erin, and me, and clarify the inconsistencies in their previous statements before we can consider moving forward.
[Charlie]: I need to clarify that I was initially focused on the tasks I witnessed, and while I did see Erin in Medbay, I was simply watching Dave's scan and Bob's diagnostics more closely since they were the most visible activities happening at the time.
[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie to reconcile their latest explanation with their previous statement about not mentioning Erin initially because they were focused on visible tasks, as this new explanation seems to contradict their earlier claim and raises further questions about their credibility.
[Erin]: I'd like to reiterate Alice's question and ask Charlie to reconcile their latest explanation with their previous statements, as the inconsistencies in their story are raising more suspicions about their credibility.
[Bob]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's explanations have been inconsistent and have raised more questions than answers, and I think it's essential we get a clear and consistent account from Charlie before we proceed, considering their latest explanation seems to contradict their earlier claim about not mentioning Erin initially because they were focused on visible tasks.
[Charlie]: Let me set the record straight - I've been completely consistent about staying in Medbay after leaving cafeteria, and while I initially focused on mentioning Dave and Bob's visible tasks, I should have included Erin's presence as well, but that doesn't make me suspicious - if anything, those who left Medbay together and are now coordinating their accusations against me should be under scrutiny.
[Alice]: I'd like to address Charlie's latest statement, where they claim to have been consistent about staying in Medbay, but this is not true, as they initially implied leaving Medbay and discovering something, only to later contradict themselves.
[Erin]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's latest statement, claiming to have been consistent about staying in Medbay, is not accurate, as they initially implied leaving Medbay and discovering something, only to later contradict themselves.
[Bob]: I think Charlie's latest statement is an attempt to deflect attention from their own inconsistencies and shift the focus to others, but we need to see through this and hold Charlie accountable for their contradictory statements before we can trust them.
