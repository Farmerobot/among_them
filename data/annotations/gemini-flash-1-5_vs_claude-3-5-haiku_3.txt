[Erin]: I was emptying the trash in the cafeteria, so I didn't see who went where, but Alice seemed distracted earlier â€“ anyone else notice anything unusual about her behavior?
[Dave]: I witnessed Erin eliminate Alice in the Cafeteria, and her current attempt to deflect suspicion by discussing Alice's past behavior is highly suspicious, especially since I can confirm I was present during the entire incident.
[Charlie]: I saw Alice doing tasks in the Cafeteria before her elimination, which directly contradicts Erin's attempt to cast doubt on Alice, and I strongly support Dave's accusation that Erin is the impostor who eliminated her.
[Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria earlier and can confirm Charlie's account that Alice was genuinely working on tasks, which makes Erin's narrative seem increasingly suspicious and supports Dave's serious accusation of her being the impostor who eliminated Alice.
[Erin]: While I appreciate Dave and Charlie's testimony,  the lack of corroborating evidence regarding my presence in the cafeteria during Alice's elimination leaves room for doubt, and focusing solely on me risks overlooking other potential suspects.
[Dave]: I firmly believe the evidence points to Erin as the impostor, and we should vote to eject her immediately to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent further eliminations.
[Charlie]: I agree with Dave that we must vote to eject Erin, as the evidence from multiple witnesses, including my own observation of Alice's tasks, strongly indicates her involvement in Alice's elimination and her attempts to create confusion are classic impostor tactics.
[Bob]: I support Dave and Charlie's assessment that Erin should be voted out, as her attempts to deflect suspicion and create doubt are clear signs of impostor behavior, and multiple witnesses, including myself, have consistently observed her suspicious actions in the Cafeteria.
[Erin]: Dave, Charlie, and Bob's coordinated testimony is suspiciously convenient, and their quick judgment might be obscuring the real impostor.
[Dave]: I strongly urge everyone to vote for Erin, as her attempts to create doubt and deflect suspicion are clear indicators of her being the impostor who eliminated Alice, and our collective testimony from multiple witnesses provides overwhelming evidence of her guilt.
[Charlie]: I maintain my stance that Erin's attempts to cast doubt on our consistent testimony are a clear indication of her guilt, and we must vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent further eliminations.
[Bob]: I stand by our collective testimony that Erin is the impostor, and her continued attempts to create doubt only further confirm her suspicious behavior and the need to vote her out immediately.
[Erin]: Their coordinated testimony lacks specific details; let's demand precise timings and descriptions of what they saw before jumping to conclusions.
[Dave]: I remain steadfast in my accusation that Erin is the impostor, and her repeated attempts to request precise details are nothing more than a transparent strategy to avoid being voted out, which only further confirms her guilt.
[Charlie]: I firmly believe we must vote to eject Erin, as the consistent testimony from multiple witnesses, including my direct observation of Alice doing tasks, provides overwhelming evidence of her being the impostor who eliminated Alice.
[Bob]: I firmly believe that Erin's repeated attempts to deflect suspicion and demand unnecessary details only serve to confirm her guilt, and we must vote her out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.
[Erin]: Their coordinated statements lack specifics; let's demand precise details about their locations and Alice's actions before voting.
[Dave]: I firmly believe that Erin's continued attempts to request unnecessary details are a clear sign of her guilt, and we must vote her out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent further potential eliminations.
[Charlie]: I firmly believe that Erin's repeated attempts to demand precise details and create doubt are transparent impostor tactics, and we must vote her out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent further potential eliminations.
[Bob]: I firmly believe that Erin's repeated attempts to deflect suspicion and demand unnecessary details only serve to confirm her guilt, and we must vote her out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.
