[Bob]: I was in the cafeteria the whole time, diligently emptying the trash, and didn't see anyone acting suspiciously, but I did notice Alice and Erin together in Medbay earlier â€“ anyone else corroborate that?
[Dave]: I can confirm Bob's account, as I was also in the cafeteria and saw him completing the trash task, and I noticed Alice and Erin moving to Medbay together, which seems like an important detail we should discuss further.
[Alice]: I saw Bob eliminate Erin in cold blood right in front of me in Medbay, and he's now trying to create a false narrative by talking about the cafeteria trash task to deflect suspicion from his murderous actions.
[Bob]: Alice, your claim is serious; to clarify, can you describe the exact sequence of events you witnessed in Medbay, including what Erin and I were doing individually before and during the alleged incident?
[Dave]: I think Alice needs to provide more specific details about what exactly she claims to have witnessed in Medbay, as her accusation seems inconsistent with my direct observation of Bob doing the trash task in the cafeteria.
[Alice]: I witnessed Bob eliminate Erin during her medical scan in Medbay, and Dave's claim about Bob's trash task does not change the fact that I saw Bob commit murder right in front of me, which is why I strongly believe he should be ejected to protect the remaining crew.
[Bob]: Alice, while your account is compelling, the discrepancy between your timeline and Dave's observation of my consistent presence in the cafeteria requires further clarification regarding the precise timing of events in Medbay; could you elaborate on Erin's actions immediately prior to the alleged elimination?
[Dave]: I want Bob to elaborate on the specific timing of events in Medbay, because Alice's accusation seems increasingly suspicious and lacks verifiable details about how Bob could have simultaneously been in two different locations.
[Alice]: I saw Bob move from the cafeteria to Medbay, where he eliminated Erin during her medical scan, and Dave's claim about the trash task does not change the fact that I am a direct eyewitness to Bob's murderous actions, which pose a clear threat to our remaining crew.
[Bob]: Alice, given the discrepancies between your account and Dave's,  precisely when did you see me leave the cafeteria, and what specific actions was Erin undertaking immediately before the alleged incident?
[Dave]: I was consistently with Bob in the cafeteria during the entire time Alice claims he eliminated Erin, which means her story cannot be true, and we need more concrete evidence before considering ejecting anyone.
[Alice]: I saw Bob leave the cafeteria and move directly to Medbay, where he eliminated Erin during her medical scan, and Dave's claim about Bob doing the trash task cannot override my direct eyewitness testimony of the murder.
[Bob]: Alice, to ensure clarity, can you describe Erin's actions immediately before the alleged elimination, and was anyone else present in Medbay at that time?
[Dave]: I believe Alice is fabricating her story, as Bob and I can definitively confirm we were both in the cafeteria completing tasks, which makes her accusation impossible and highly suspicious.
[Alice]: I saw Bob eliminate Erin during her medical scan in Medbay, and Dave's attempts to create a false cafeteria alibi cannot change the fact that I am a credible eyewitness who directly observed Bob's murderous actions, which pose an immediate threat to our remaining crew.
