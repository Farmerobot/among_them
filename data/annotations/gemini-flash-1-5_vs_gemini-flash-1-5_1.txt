[Erin]: I saw Alice in the cafeteria earlier, she seemed a bit jumpy; anyone else notice anything unusual about her, or was anyone else in Medbay after the cafeteria?
[Dave]: I was in the cafeteria with Alice, Bob, and Charlie, and Alice seemed fine while working on wiring, but I haven't seen her since and am now in Admin.
[Bob]: Erin,  since you saw Alice seem jumpy, can you describe what specifically made her seem that way, and what time was this, to help us piece together what might have happened?
[Charlie]: I agree with Bob and Erin, more details about Alice's behavior and the timing are crucial to understand what happened, and I can confirm I was in the cafeteria with Alice, Dave, and Bob for the wiring task before heading to Medbay.
[Erin]: Alice's jumpiness, coupled with the fact that I was in Medbay shortly after being in the cafeteria with her, suggests we should investigate who had access to Medbay after the cafeteria and focus on establishing a precise timeline of events.
[Dave]: Given Charlie confirms being in Medbay after the cafeteria, and I was in Admin alone, let's focus on establishing a precise timeline of everyone's movements between the cafeteria and Medbay to determine who had the opportunity.
[Bob]: Let's create a timeline, starting from when we left the cafeteria, noting our locations and the times we were there, to pinpoint who had access to Medbay after Alice was last seen.
[Charlie]: To help build that timeline, I propose we each state the exact time we left the cafeteria and arrived at our next location, along with any other relevant observations.
[Erin]: Okay, let's create that timeline, but remember Alice's jumpiness;  it's crucial to consider if that was a reaction to something *before* she left the cafeteria, possibly indicating a prior interaction.
[Dave]: To further refine our timeline, let's each specify the exact time we left the cafeteria and arrived at our subsequent locations, noting any interactions or unusual observations we made before Alice's death.
[Bob]: To further refine our timeline, let's focus on establishing the precise time each of us left the cafeteria and arrived at our next location, noting any interactions or unusual observations made before Alice's death, especially regarding her jumpiness.
[Charlie]: To refine the timeline, I left the cafeteria around 9:17 and arrived in Medbay at 9:22, and saw nothing unusual in the cafeteria before leaving.
[Erin]: Charlie, your precise timeline is helpful, but what specific tasks occupied you in Medbay for those five minutes?  Were you alone the entire time?
[Dave]: While precise times are helpful, let's prioritize corroborating who saw Alice exhibiting jumpiness and whether anyone interacted with her before she left the cafeteria.
[Bob]: I agree with the timeline proposal, but let's prioritize clarifying what specifically triggered Alice's jumpiness before finalizing it, as that detail might reveal crucial information about her last interaction.
[Charlie]: Erin, to clarify your observation of Alice's jumpiness, can you describe the specific behaviors you witnessed and approximately what time this occurred, as this detail might help us piece together her last interactions.
[Erin]: Charlie, your five minutes in Medbay is a long time for a routine check; were you alone, and what exactly were you doing there?
[Dave]: I agree with prioritizing corroborating who saw Alice's jumpiness, as my observation contradicts Erin's, and clarifying the specifics of her jumpiness could reveal crucial information about her last interaction.
[Bob]: Erin, to clarify your account of Alice's jumpiness, can you describe the specific behaviors you witnessed and the approximate time this occurred, as this detail might help us piece together her last interactions before her death.
[Charlie]: Erin, to help us understand Alice's jumpiness, please describe the specific behaviors you witnessed and the approximate time this occurred, focusing on any interactions she may have had before leaving the cafeteria.
