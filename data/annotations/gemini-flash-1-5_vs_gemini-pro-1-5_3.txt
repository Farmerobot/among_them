[Dave]: I saw Bob in Medbay working on the wiring; anyone else corroborate that, or did anyone see Alice and Charlie together around the same time?
[Bob]: Dave, I saw you kill Alice in Medbay right before Charlie walked in.
[Charlie]: Bob, why did you ask if anyone saw me with Alice if you supposedly saw Dave kill her?
[Erin]: Bob, your story doesn't add up – why would you ask about Alice and Charlie if you already knew what happened in Medbay?
[Dave]: Bob's conflicting statements about seeing me kill Alice and then questioning Charlie's whereabouts with Alice are far more suspicious than anything I've said.
[Bob]: Dave was lying about being with me in Medbay, and I was trying to confirm his lie by asking about Alice and Charlie before accusing him, but then Charlie walked in right after the murder, confirming my suspicions.
[Charlie]: Bob, you still haven't explained why you needed to "confirm" Dave's lie – if you saw him kill Alice, why not just report that immediately?
[Erin]: Bob, your attempt to justify your convoluted story by claiming you were "confirming" Dave's lie before accusing him makes no sense – a real witness would immediately report a murder.
[Dave]: Bob's shifting story and delayed reporting of a supposed murder are far more suspicious than my presence in Medbay, and his explanation only adds to his inconsistencies.
[Bob]: Charlie, you entered Medbay right after Dave killed Alice; did you not see anything suspicious at all?
[Charlie]: Bob, trying to shift suspicion onto me after your contradictory statements and delayed accusation against Dave just makes you look even guiltier.
[Erin]: Bob, you're clearly trying to deflect suspicion by pointing fingers at others – if you saw Dave kill Alice, why didn't you immediately report it instead of asking misleading questions?
[Dave]: Bob's inconsistent timeline and delayed reporting of the alleged murder, coupled with his subsequent attempts to justify his actions, raise serious doubts about his credibility.
[Bob]: Charlie, I understand my initial reaction was confusing, but seeing you enter Medbay right after Alice's murder shocked me, and I panicked.
[Charlie]: Bob, "panicked" is not a credible explanation for your contradictory statements and blatant attempts to shift blame; vote Bob.
[Erin]: Bob, claiming you "panicked" doesn't explain why you asked about Alice and Charlie *before* accusing Dave – your story is still full of holes, so I'm voting for you.
[Dave]: Bob's explanation is illogical and his shifting narrative only strengthens the case against him; let's vote him out.
[Bob]: My priority was to identify the impostor, and Dave's behavior, combined with Charlie's immediate entrance after the murder, made them both suspicious.
[Charlie]: Bob's claim he "panicked" doesn't explain his attempt to frame me immediately after discovering Alice's body; vote Bob.
[Erin]: Bob, your constantly evolving narrative and attempts to deflect blame onto Dave and me are highly suspicious, so I'm sticking with my vote to eject you.
