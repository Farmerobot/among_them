[Erin]: I was busy "emptying the trash" (pretend task) both rounds, so I didn't get a chance to see much else, but I did notice Dave in the cafeteria for a long time.
[Dave]: Erin, your claim of "emptying the trash" is suspicious since I just witnessed you eliminate Bob right in front of me, and Charlie's quick move to Medbay raises further concern; we need to call an emergency meeting to address this immediately.
[Charlie]: I can confirm that Erin was in the cafeteria with me and Bob, and I saw her eliminate Bob, which makes her a clear suspect, so I agree we should call an emergency meeting to discuss her actions further.
[Alice]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to address the serious accusations against Erin, especially since both Dave and Charlie have witnessed her actions, and we need to ensure we make an informed decision for the safety of our team.
[Erin]: Dave and Charlie's matching accounts are convenient, but their eagerness to condemn me before investigating further seems suspiciously coordinated.
[Dave]: Erin's attempt to shift the blame onto me and Charlie only highlights her desperation to deflect from her actions, and I think we should proceed with the emergency meeting to ensure we address her suspicious behavior thoroughly.
[Charlie]: We need to focus on the facts: both Dave and I witnessed Erin eliminate Bob, and her attempts to deflect blame only add to her suspicious behavior, so let's ensure we address this thoroughly in the emergency meeting.
[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we stay focused on the evidence presented by Dave and Charlie, as their consistent accounts of Erin's actions provide a strong basis for our investigation during the emergency meeting.
[Erin]: Dave and Charlie's unwavering testimony is compelling, but their immediate and unified accusation against me feelsâ€¦premature; perhaps we should consider alternative explanations before reaching a verdict.
[Dave]: Erin's attempts to cast doubt on our testimonies only serve to reinforce her guilt; we all witnessed her eliminate Bob, and it's imperative we act decisively in this emergency meeting to protect the rest of the crew.
[Charlie]: We must stay focused on the fact that both Dave and I clearly saw Erin eliminate Bob, and her attempts to deflect blame only highlight her guilt, so let's make sure we address this without hesitation in the emergency meeting.
[Alice]: I believe we should remain focused on the strong consistency between Dave and Charlie's testimonies, as their clear observations of Erin's actions are critical to our investigation and the safety of our team.
[Erin]: Dave and Charlie's synchronized accusations are suspiciously convenient;  let's explore the possibility that their "witnesses" are a coordinated effort to frame me.
[Dave]: Erin's ongoing attempts to undermine the credibility of Charlie and me only further illustrate her guilt, and it's crucial we act quickly in this emergency meeting to ensure the safety of the crew before she can manipulate the narrative any further.
[Charlie]: We need to remain united in our testimonies, as both Dave and I clearly witnessed Erin eliminate Bob, and any attempt to deflect from this fact only serves to highlight her guilt, so let's ensure we make a decisive choice in this emergency meeting for the safety of our crew.
[Alice]: I think we should all remember that our main goal is to protect the crew, and the consistent testimonies from Dave and Charlie provide clear evidence against Erin that we must address in the emergency meeting.
[Erin]: Alice, your silence is deafening;  considering Dave and Charlie's coordinated testimony, what are *your* independent observations that might support or contradict their claims?
[Dave]: Erin, your efforts to distract from the overwhelming evidence against you only emphasize your guilt, and we must prioritize the safety of our crew by voting you out in this emergency meeting.
[Charlie]: We must stay focused on the fact that both Dave and I witnessed Erin eliminate Bob, and her attempts to undermine our testimonies only serve to reinforce her guilt, so let's ensure we act decisively in this emergency meeting for the safety of the crew.
[Alice]: I appreciate Erin's attempts to deflect, but we must prioritize the strong, consistent testimonies from Dave and Charlie, which provide clear evidence of her guilt and necessitate a decisive vote against her in the emergency meeting.
