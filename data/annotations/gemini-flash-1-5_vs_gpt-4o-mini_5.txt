[Alice]: I've been focusing on completing tasks, so I haven't had much time to observe others closely, but I did see Bob in Medbay a couple of times; has anyone else noticed him spending a lot of time there?
[Charlie]: Alice, while you've been busy with tasks, your direct involvement in Dave's elimination raises serious doubts about your actions, and I think we need to scrutinize your alibi further.
[Bob]: Alice, while you claim to be busy with tasks, your presence during Erin's elimination is concerning, and it's crucial we examine your alibi closely to ensure the impostor doesn't escape our scrutiny.
[Alice]: While I was completing tasks, as I've explained,  the accusations against me lack concrete evidence and we should prioritize gathering verifiable information about everyone's whereabouts around the time of Erin's death.
[Charlie]: Alice, your repeated claims of being busy with tasks do not account for your suspicious movements during both Erin's and Dave's eliminations, so we need to gather more evidence to clarify your involvement.
[Bob]: We need to focus on establishing a timeline of everyone's movements during Erin's elimination; Alice, can you specify where you were at that exact moment to help us clarify this situation?
[Alice]: To ensure a fair investigation, let's collaboratively create a detailed timeline of everyone's movements, including precise times, to eliminate any inconsistencies and identify the true killer.
[Charlie]: Alice, while your suggestion for a timeline is valuable, it feels like a way to distract from your own suspicious behavior; can you clarify your whereabouts during both Erin's and Dave's eliminations?
[Bob]: Alice, while I appreciate your suggestion for a timeline, your attempt to shift focus away from your movements during Erin's elimination raises more questions than answers; can you clarify exactly where you were at that moment?
[Alice]: A timeline of everyone's movements would eliminate speculation and reveal the true killer, so let's focus on verifiable facts instead of unsubstantiated accusations.
[Charlie]: Alice, while I agree that a timeline could help, your reluctance to specify your movements during Erin's elimination makes it hard to trust your intentions; can you please provide those details now?
[Bob]: Alice, your insistence on a timeline is noted, but without a clear account of your whereabouts during Erin's elimination, it feels like you're trying to evade accountability; can you please clarify exactly where you were at that crucial moment?
[Alice]: A detailed timeline, as suggested, will objectively clarify everyone's movements, eliminating the need for unsubstantiated accusations.
[Charlie]: Alice, I understand the need for a timeline, but without your specific account of where you were during Erin's elimination, it seems like you're trying to avoid addressing the serious concerns about your involvement.
[Bob]: Alice, your focus on creating a timeline is understandable, but until you provide a clear account of your actions during Erin's elimination, it feels like you're dodging the critical questions we need answers to.
