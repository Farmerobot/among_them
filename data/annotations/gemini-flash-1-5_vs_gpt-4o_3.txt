[Dave]: I saw Charlie in Medbay earlier, anyone else see him around then?
[Bob]: I didn't see Charlie after he left for Medbay with you, Dave; can anyone else confirm where he went next?
[Alice]: I was in the cafeteria with Dave, Bob, and Charlie earlier, and we all did tasks there; I didn't see where Charlie went after that, but Erin and I moved to Weapons, and I never saw Charlie there.
[Erin]: I can confirm that Alice and I were in Weapons together, and I didn't see Charlie at all during the rounds, so we should focus on verifying everyone's task completion and movements to narrow down the possibilities.
[Dave]: It's concerning that Charlie disappeared after Medbay;  let's meticulously compare our timelines to pinpoint when and where he was last seen.
[Bob]: Let's focus on who was in Medbay or nearby around the time Charlie disappeared, as this could help us identify potential suspects.
[Alice]: I remember seeing Dave move to Medbay from the cafeteria, so he could provide more details about the time he spent there.
[Erin]: Dave, since you were the last one seen with Charlie in Medbay, can you tell us if you noticed anyone else coming or going from there?
[Dave]: I was preoccupied with a task in Medbay and might have missed someone entering or leaving, but I can confirm I was alone with Charlie for a short time before he disappeared.
[Bob]: Let's scrutinize Dave's timeline in Medbay closely, as he was the last person with Charlie, and see if anyone else can confirm their movements or presence there.
[Alice]: I think it's important to focus on the timeline in Medbayâ€”Dave, you mentioned being alone with Charlie briefly, can you specify what task you were doing there?
[Erin]: Dave, could you clarify which task you were working on in Medbay and how long it took, as this might help us determine if anyone else could have entered unnoticed?
[Dave]: To effectively investigate Charlie's disappearance, let's create a shared timeline detailing everyone's location and tasks during the relevant rounds, focusing on those near Medbay.
[Bob]: I agree with Dave's suggestion to create a shared timeline; let's all list our locations and tasks during the rounds in question, especially those near Medbay, to help us identify any inconsistencies.
[Alice]: I agree with creating a shared timeline, and I'll start by sharing mine: I began in the Cafeteria with Dave, Bob, and Charlie, then moved to Weapons with Erin, completing tasks in both locations.
[Erin]: I agree with creating a shared timeline to help us identify any inconsistencies, so I'll start by sharing mine: I was in the Cafeteria with Alice, Dave, Bob, and Charlie, then moved to Weapons with Alice, where I saw her do a task.
[Dave]: I agree with the shared timeline suggestion; my fuzzy memory of Medbay might contain crucial details if we compare notes carefully.
[Bob]: Since Alice and Erin have shared their timelines, I'll share mine: I started in the Cafeteria, completing tasks like starting the coffee maker and emptying the trash, before moving to Admin.
[Alice]: Bob, since you moved to Admin after the Cafeteria, did you notice anyone coming from or going towards Medbay during your transition?
[Erin]: [Bob, you mentioned moving to Admin after the Cafeteria; did you see anyone else on your way there or notice anything unusual that might help us piece together Charlie's movements?]
