[Charlie]: I saw Alice vent in Electrical.
[Bob]: Charlie, that's a blatant lie to deflect suspicion, I saw you kill Dave in the Cafeteria!
[Alice]: Bob can confirm I was nowhere near Electrical; we were both in the Cafeteria at the start of the game, so vote Charlie – he's clearly lying.
[Erin]: Bob and Alice can both vouch for me as well, I was with them in the Cafeteria at the start, so Charlie's claim about Alice is impossible.
[Charlie]: If Bob and Alice were together the whole time, wouldn't they have seen *me* in the Cafeteria too, proving my innocence?
[Bob]: Exactly, Charlie – you *were* in the Cafeteria with us at the start, which is why your claim about Alice is impossible, *and* why I saw you kill Dave there immediately afterward.
[Alice]: Charlie's trying to backtrack now, but his initial lie about me venting proves he's the impostor, so let's vote him out.
[Erin]: Charlie's attempt to rewrite his story only confirms his guilt, so let's vote him out before he can kill again.
[Charlie]: So, Bob, you conveniently saw me kill Dave *right after* we were all together, yet no one else witnessed this supposed murder?
[Bob]: Charlie, are you seriously suggesting that *nobody* would notice a murder happening in the Cafeteria, a central and frequently visited location?
[Alice]: Charlie's asking why no one else saw the murder is suspicious in itself – is he trying to imply *he* was looking for witnesses, because *he* was the murderer?
[Erin]: Charlie's increasingly desperate attempts to deflect blame only solidify his guilt; let's eject him now.
[Charlie]: Isn't it strange how Bob's story conveniently places him as the *sole* witness to Dave's death, despite the Cafeteria being a busy area?
[Bob]: Charlie, you're twisting things, the Cafeteria *was* busy at the start, with myself, Alice, Erin, *and you* – you killed Dave right after Erin left, so it wasn't a crowded room, but it also wasn't empty.
[Alice]: Charlie's trying to discredit Bob's testimony because it directly implicates him in Dave's murder, remember, Charlie's initial lie about me venting proves he's the impostor.
[Erin]: Charlie's trying to create reasonable doubt by suggesting Bob is the only witness, but Bob already explained the Cafeteria emptied out shortly after the game began, leaving him alone with Charlie when the murder happened.
[Charlie]: Bob, you keep saying I killed Dave *right* after Erin left, but how long exactly was that? A minute? Two? Give us a precise timeline.
[Bob]: Charlie,  Erin left just long enough for you to kill Dave and think you could get away with it, stop trying to stall.
[Alice]: Charlie's desperate demand for an exact timeline is a classic stalling tactic; Bob's account is consistent, and we need to vote Charlie out now.
[Erin]: Charlie's relentless focus on minor details instead of addressing the core accusation – that he killed Dave – only reinforces his guilt.
