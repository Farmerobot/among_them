[Alice]: I think we should focus on discussing our alibis more closely, as Erin might have seen something important when she left Medbay, and it could help us identify any inconsistencies in what others are saying.
[Charlie]: I saw multiple people doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier, and I'm deeply concerned about Dave's sudden elimination - Alice, can you provide more details about exactly what happened in Medbay when Dave was killed?
[Erin]: I saw Alice eliminate Dave in Medbay, and I believe she is the impostor who needs to be voted out immediately.
[Alice]: Erin's accusation seems very convenient, especially since she was the last to leave Medbay; we should consider her movements closely and see if anyone else has a different account of what happened.
[Charlie]: I can definitively confirm Erin's statement: I was in Medbay and directly witnessed Alice eliminating Dave, so we must vote Alice out to protect the remaining crewmates.
[Erin]: I believe we have clear evidence from both myself and Charlie that Alice is the impostor, and we must vote her out to prevent further eliminations and protect our remaining team.
[Alice]: It's quite suspicious that both Erin and Charlie have the same story about me, and I think we should investigate their claims furtherâ€”perhaps we can uncover a possible collusion between them that could lead us to the real impostor.
[Charlie]: I stand by my testimony and urge everyone to vote Alice out, as both Erin and I have consistently witnessed her eliminating Dave in Medbay, and her attempts to deflect suspicion only further confirm her guilt as the impostor.
[Erin]: I firmly believe Alice's attempts to create doubt about our consistent testimony are transparent impostor tactics designed to avoid being voted out, and we must vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates.
[Alice]: It's interesting that both Erin and Charlie are so quick to accuse me without considering any inconsistencies in their own stories; perhaps we should take a closer look at their movements and see if anyone else can provide a different account of what happened in Medbay.
[Charlie]: I believe Alice's repeated attempts to cast doubt on our consistent testimony only further prove her guilt, and we must vote her out to prevent any more crewmate eliminations.
[Erin]: Alice's repeated attempts to deflect and create confusion only confirm her guilt, and both Charlie and I have provided clear, consistent testimony that she eliminated Dave in Medbay, so we must vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates.
[Alice]: It's interesting that both Erin and Charlie are so adamant about their claims; perhaps we should focus on reviewing their alibis and see if their stories hold up under scrutiny, as this could reveal the truth behind Dave's elimination.
[Charlie]: I stand by my testimony that Alice is the impostor who eliminated Dave in Medbay, and her continued attempts to create doubt only further confirm her guilt, so we must vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates.
[Erin]: We must vote Alice out now, as both Charlie and I have consistently and independently witnessed her eliminating Dave in Medbay, and her continued attempts to create confusion only prove her guilt as the impostor.
