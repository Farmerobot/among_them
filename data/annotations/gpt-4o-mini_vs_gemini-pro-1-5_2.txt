[Dave]: Since I saw Bob move to Admin, we should definitely keep an eye on him; being alone in there for a while gives him a perfect opportunity to eliminate someone without witnesses.
[Bob]: I was only in Admin for a minute, Dave, just long enough to swipe my card for the 'Clean the floor' task –  why are you so focused on me?
[Alice]: I can confirm Dave's statement, I saw him doing the coffee task in Cafeteria, and Bob, if you were only in Admin for a minute, it's strange Dave saw you there for longer.
[Erin]: Dave killed Charlie right in front of me in Cafeteria after he faked the coffee task; don't listen to his lies about Bob.
[Dave]: Erin's accusation is quite serious, yet she was the only one with me in the Cafeteria, and if she truly witnessed a murder, why didn't she report it sooner?
[Bob]: Erin, thank you for speaking up; it's clear Dave is trying to deflect suspicion by falsely accusing me.
[Alice]: Erin, please clarify where in Cafeteria you saw the murder, as my confirmation of Dave doing the coffee task might help pinpoint the exact location and timing.
[Erin]: Dave, I reported the body as soon as I saw it; you were literally standing over Charlie near the coffee maker after faking the task twice.
[Dave]: Erin, your timeline seems inconsistent; if you reported the body immediately, why didn't you mention it until now, and Bob, your attempts to shift blame onto me only raise more suspicion about your own actions in Admin.
[Bob]: Alice, after I swiped my card in Admin, I went straight to Medbay – did you see me enter?
[Alice]: Bob, I was in Medbay for several rounds and didn't see you come in, so either you weren't there, or you were very quiet about it.
[Erin]: Alice, I saw Dave kill Charlie near the coffee maker right after he pretended to do the task, and I reported it immediately – Dave's trying to confuse us with irrelevant details about Bob and Admin.
[Dave]: Erin, if you truly reported the body immediately, why are you only bringing this up now, and Bob, your shaky alibi only adds to the suspicion that you both might be colluding to eliminate crewmates like me?
[Bob]: Dave, your continued attempts to deflect blame onto me and Erin only further solidify your guilt – we need to vote you out now.
[Alice]: Dave, your desperate attempts to link Bob and me together are failing;  it's clear you're trying to avoid the fact that both Erin and I place you at the scene of the crime.
[Erin]: Alice, remember when you left Cafeteria, Dave was by the coffee maker, and that's EXACTLY where he killed Charlie moments later, proving he lied about doing the task.
[Dave]: Erin, your insistence on my guilt seems to be a desperate attempt to divert attention from your own inconsistencies, especially since you were the only one with me in Cafeteria—why didn't you report it sooner or call an emergency meeting right away?
[Bob]: Dave, your repeated questioning of Erin's reporting timing is a classic diversion tactic, and both Erin and Alice have placed you at the scene, so we need to vote you out.
[Alice]: Dave, your deflection tactics are transparent; both Erin and I saw you near the coffee maker where Charlie died, so stop trying to shift blame onto Bob and answer our questions directly.
[Erin]: Dave, you're asking why I didn't report it sooner, but I DID report it immediately – you're twisting my words to create confusion and avoid the fact that both Alice and I saw you at the murder scene.
