[Charlie]: I noticed that both Dave and Erin were doing the Submit Scan task in Medbay, which seems like a good alibi for them, but we should keep an eye on their movements as they could be working together; also, has anyone checked on Bob since he was doing a task in the Cafeteria earlier?
[Dave]: Charlie, I appreciate you confirming our alibis, and yes, we should definitely check on Bob; where were *you* during this time?
[Alice]: Charlie, I saw you kill Bob in Cafeteria, then I ran to Admin.
[Charlie]: Alice, if you truly saw me kill Bob, why didn't you report it right away instead of running to Admin, and how do we know your story isn't just a cover to deflect suspicion from yourself?
[Dave]: Alice, good catch on reporting that. Where were you before Cafeteria?
[Alice]: Dave, I was with Bob and Charlie in Cafeteria before I saw Charlie kill Bob.
[Charlie]: Alice, your accusation seems to be a convenient way to deflect attention from yourself; if you were truly with us in Cafeteria, why didn't you report the body immediately?
[Dave]: Alice, if you were with Bob and Charlie in the Cafeteria, did you see anyone else enter or leave before you witnessed the incident?
[Alice]: Charlie, stop trying to deflect by questioning my motives; I saw you vent in Cafeteria right after Bob died.
[Charlie]: [Alice, your claim about me venting raises serious questions; if you were truly there, why didn't you report the body immediately, and who else did you see in the Cafeteria?]
[Dave]: Alice, focusing on the vent location details will help us verify your claim, so please describe where the vent is in the Cafeteria.
[Alice]: The vent is on the south wall of the Cafeteria, near the trash disposal, Dave, and I was too shocked to report immediately after witnessing Charlie kill Bob.
[Charlie]: [Alice, your explanation about being too shocked to report the body immediately seems like a weak excuse; if you truly witnessed a murder, wouldnâ€™t your instinct be to report it right away instead of running to Admin?]
[Dave]: Alice, thanks for clarifying the vent location; can anyone else confirm the vent's position in the Cafeteria?
[Alice]: Dave, I ran to Admin because I was scared, and Charlie's repeated questioning of my motives is suspicious.
