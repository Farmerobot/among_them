[Erin]: I was in the Admin room for a while, and I saw Bob and Charlie there at different times; they seemed to be doing their tasks, but I didn't see anyone else.
[Bob]: I can confirm seeing Erin in Admin while completing tasks, and it seemed like she was also working on tasks.
[Charlie]: I can confirm Erin's account of seeing me in Admin, and it's reassuring that Bob corroborates our presence there while completing tasks.
[Alice]: It's reassuring to hear such strong corroboration from Erin, Bob, and Charlie regarding their time in Admin, suggesting we should investigate other areas of the ship for any suspicious activity.
[Erin]: Let's focus on identifying who wasn't in Admin during the last few rounds, as that might lead us to who could have been near Dave when he was eliminated.
[Bob]: I agree with Alice and Erin; focusing on who wasn't in Admin and compiling a list of everyone's whereabouts during that time, especially around Lower Engine, is crucial to finding Dave's killer.
[Charlie]: I agree with Erin's suggestion to focus on who wasn't in Admin;  let's create a timeline of everyone's locations to pinpoint any inconsistencies.
[Alice]: To help build that timeline, I can confirm I was alone in Admin, Storage, Communications, and O2 for significant periods;  this lack of witnesses doesn't make me suspicious, but it underscores how easily someone could have acted without being seen.
[Erin]: Let's also consider the possibility of someone moving quickly between rooms, as it might explain how they avoided detection while eliminating Dave.
[Bob]: I agree with Erin's suggestion to create a timeline of everyone's movements, focusing on those who weren't in Admin and were near Lower Engine around the time Dave was eliminated, to identify any inconsistencies.
[Charlie]: Focusing on the time immediately before Dave's death, and who was near Lower Engine then, is crucial, especially considering the corroborated accounts of our time in Admin.
[Alice]: Focusing on the pre-death timeframe near Lower Engine,  my extended solo time in various rooms highlights how easily someone could have acted unseen, so let's prioritize identifying anyone near that area then.
[Erin]: Let's verify if anyone had the chance to move between Lower Engine and other areas without being seen, as this might reveal Dave's eliminator.
[Bob]: To efficiently identify the imposter, let's prioritize comparing our individual timelines, focusing on locations near the Lower Engine room immediately before Dave's death.
[Charlie]: To efficiently solve this, let's systematically compare our individual timelines, focusing on proximity to the Lower Engine immediately before Dave's death.
[Alice]: To efficiently identify the imposter, let's systematically compare our individual timelines, focusing on those near Lower Engine immediately before Dave's death, and cross-reference that with who wasn't in Admin during that period.
[Erin]: Let's also consider if anyone could have used vents to move between rooms quickly, as this might explain how they avoided detection while eliminating Dave.
[Bob]: To efficiently solve this, let's create a timeline focusing on everyone's location near Lower Engine in the moments before Dave's death, cross-referencing that with who wasn't in Admin during that time.
[Charlie]: Given the corroborated accounts of our time in Admin, let's prioritize comparing timelines for those near Lower Engine immediately before Dave's death, cross-referencing that with who wasn't in Admin.
[Alice]: To pinpoint the killer, let's collaboratively create a precise timeline focusing on the minutes before Dave's death, noting locations and potential vent usage near Lower Engine, cross-referencing this with who wasn't in Admin.
