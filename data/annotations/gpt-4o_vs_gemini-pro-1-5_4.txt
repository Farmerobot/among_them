[Charlie]: I've been in Admin for a while, and it's been really quiet here; has anyone seen any suspicious activity elsewhere?
[Erin]: I was with Alice in Medbay and Upper Engine, and she seemed to be working on tasks, Charlie, did you see anyone pass through Admin on their way to or from those areas?
[Bob]: Charlie, I saw you in Cafeteria earlier, then later in Admin, so that confirms your location; Erin, that's helpful information, thanks.
[Dave]: Erin and Bob, I can confirm I saw Charlie in Cafeteria earlier, then later with me in Weapons, so that lines up with what they're saying.
[Charlie]: It seems like Erin was the last to see Alice alive; Erin, did you notice anyone following you or Alice during your tasks?
[Erin]: Bob and Dave, thanks for confirming Charlie's location; Charlie, did you check the security logs like I asked, and has anyone else seen anything suspicious?
[Bob]: Erin, to clarify, after you and Alice left Medbay, you went directly to Upper Engine, and then where did you go, and did you see Alice go anywhere else after Upper Engine?
[Dave]: Erin, after Upper Engine, I went to Navigation, then Shields, and didn't see Alice or anyone suspicious, but I agree checking Security is crucial, has anyone done that yet?
[Charlie]: Let's focus on Erin's movements after she was last seen with Alice; Erin, did you go anywhere else after Upper Engine?
[Erin]: Bob, to answer your question, after Upper Engine, I went back to Medbay, then briefly to Weapons, then back to Medbay where I am now. I didn't see Alice after Upper Engine, and I haven't seen her since.
[Bob]: Erin, thanks for clarifying your movements. So, you and Alice were in Medbay, then Upper Engine. After that, you lost sight of Alice, went back to Medbay, then briefly to Weapons, and then back to Medbay. Is that correct?
[Dave]: Erin, to be absolutely clear, after Upper Engine, you went directly to Medbay, then Weapons, then back to Medbay, and you're certain you didn't see Alice anywhere during those movements?
[Charlie]: Erin, your back-and-forth between Medbay and Weapons seems unusual; could you clarify if anyone else was around during those times?
[Erin]: Yes, Bob and Dave, that is absolutely correct. I went directly from Upper Engine to Medbay, then briefly to Weapons, and then back to Medbay. I didn't see Alice after Upper Engine.
[Bob]: Erin, can you recall if anyone else was in Medbay or Weapons when you were there after Upper Engine?
[Dave]: Erin, when you were briefly in Weapons, did you see me there, as I was there for a while completing a task?
[Charlie]: Erin, your movements are quite erratic, and since you were the last to see Alice, we need to know if anyone else was around Medbay or Weapons to confirm your story.
[Erin]: Dave, I didn't see you in Weapons; I was only there for a moment to check if anyone was there, and it's possible you arrived shortly after I left.
[Bob]: Erin, you said you went to Weapons to "check if anyone was there," but if you didn't see anyone, why is it relevant to your story about Alice?
[Dave]: Erin, if you were only in Weapons briefly to "check if anyone was there," why didn't you mention that earlier when we were discussing everyone's locations?
