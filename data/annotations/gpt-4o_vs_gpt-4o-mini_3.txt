[Erin]: I've been in Admin for a while now, and I've seen Bob, Charlie, and Dave coming in and out quite a bit; maybe we should check with others if they noticed anything unusual in Storage or the Cafeteria.
[Bob]: I can confirm that I was in Cafeteria earlier and didn't see anything suspicious, but Erin, since you were in Admin, did you notice if anyone else passed through there or any unusual behavior?
[Dave]: I agree with Bob's point about Erin's observations in Admin, but we still need to clarify what she was doing there and if anyone can confirm her task completion while we were all present.
[Alice]: Erin, if you were in Admin for a while, can you specify which tasks you completed and why you didn't see anyone else, especially since Bob, Charlie, and I were all in Cafeteria together?
[Erin]: I was pretending to swipe the card in Admin, so I didn't notice much else, but did anyone see Charlie leave Admin before he was found?
[Bob]: I find it concerning that Erin was only pretending to swipe the card in Admin, and since Charlie was the last seen with her, we should definitely gather more information from anyone who was nearby to clarify what really happened.
[Dave]: I agree with Bob; Erin's admission about pretending to swipe the card in Admin raises serious concerns, and we need to pinpoint her exact timeline and task completion before making any decisions.
[Alice]: Erin, your admission of "pretending" to swipe the card in Admin is indeed alarming; could you clarify why you were there for so long without noticing anyone else, and can anyone confirm your presence in that room during the time Charlie was last seen?
[Erin]: I meant to say that I was swiping the card, but it took me a few tries to get it right—it's a tricky task sometimes, and I might have been distracted, but Dave was also there, so maybe he can confirm my presence.
[Bob]: Erin, your explanation about pretending to swipe the card raises significant doubts; we need a detailed account of your actions in Admin and any confirmation from Dave or others regarding your task completion to ensure we’re not overlooking something crucial.
[Dave]: I find it hard to believe that Erin was genuinely focused on swiping the card for that long without noticing anything else around her, and we should definitely prioritize clarifying her timeline and actions in Admin before making any decisions.
[Alice]: Erin's inconsistent statements about her actions in Admin and her admission of pretending to swipe the card are deeply concerning, and I believe we should seriously consider voting her out to protect the crew.
[Erin]: I understand the concerns about my card swiping; it’s a tricky task and can take a few tries, but let's not forget that Charlie was last seen with Dave before he moved to Storage—has anyone checked if there’s anything suspicious there?
[Bob]: Erin's inconsistent statements and her admission of pretending to swipe the card in Admin are highly suspicious, and we need to focus on gathering more information about her actions and timeline before considering any other leads.
[Dave]: Erin's admission of pretending to swipe the card in Admin is not only suspicious but also indicates a lack of accountability; we must focus on her inconsistent statements and consider voting her out to ensure the safety of the crew.
[Alice]: Erin's repeated inconsistencies and her admission of "pretending" to swipe the card in Admin are too concerning to ignore, and I believe we must vote her out to protect the crew from potential impostor actions.
[Erin]: I understand the concerns about my card swiping, but let's not overlook that Dave was the last person seen with Charlie before he moved to Storage, and we should investigate there for any unusual activity.
[Bob]: Erin's shifting narrative about her time in Admin, especially her admission of pretending to swipe the card, is a significant red flag that we cannot ignore, and we should prioritize voting her out to protect the crew.
[Dave]: Erin's attempt to deflect the blame onto me regarding Charlie's whereabouts only adds to the growing evidence against her, and we need to act decisively to vote her out for the safety of the crew.
[Alice]: Erin’s continued attempts to shift blame onto others, combined with her admission of pretending to swipe the card, clearly indicate her guilt, and it's time we act decisively to vote her out for the safety of the crew.
