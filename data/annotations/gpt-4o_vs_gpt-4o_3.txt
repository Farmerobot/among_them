[Bob]: I've been mostly in the Cafeteria and Navigation, keeping an eye on people moving around, and I noticed Alice moved around a lot; maybe we should ask her about her tasks and movements.
[Erin]: I can confirm that Alice was moving frequently between rooms, but I saw her doing tasks like Calibrate targeting system in Weapons and Adjust course in Navigation.
[Charlie]: I was in Weapons earlier and saw Alice doing tasks, so her movements align with what Erin said; let's focus on finishing our tasks to win.
[Bob]: I noticed Dave was in the Cafeteria for a while doing tasks, but I didn't see him leave; does anyone know where he went after that?
[Erin]: Alice, since both Bob and I noticed your frequent movements, can you clarify your task progress and whether you saw anyone else near Dave in the Cafeteria?
[Charlie]: Alice, could you provide more details about your tasks after leaving Navigation, and did you see anyone else around Dave in the Cafeteria before he was found?
[Bob]: We should definitely hear from Dave about his whereabouts after the Cafeteria, as he seemed to disappear after doing tasks there.
[Erin]: Let's make sure we have a clear understanding of everyone's task progress to ensure we don't overlook any critical tasks left to complete.
[Charlie]: Alice, since both Bob and Erin have mentioned your movements, can you clarify if you saw anyone else near Dave in the Cafeteria before he was found?
[Bob]: Alice, could you walk us through your task sequence and let us know if you saw anyone else around Dave in the Cafeteria or noticed anything unusual during your movements?
[Erin]: Alice, could you confirm if you saw Dave at any point after the Cafeteria, or if you noticed anything unusual during your movements?
[Charlie]: Alice, it seems like everyone is curious about your movements; can you confirm if you saw Dave after leaving the Cafeteria, and did you notice anything unusual during your tasks?
[Bob]: Alice, while we're waiting for your response, Dave, could you clarify where you went after the Cafeteria and if you saw anything suspicious?
[Erin]: Dave, we need to hear from you about your movements after the Cafeteria to piece together what happened and ensure we complete our tasks efficiently.
[Charlie]: Alice, since both Bob and Erin have covered your movements, let's also hear from Dave about his whereabouts after the Cafeteria to help us focus on completing our tasks efficiently.
