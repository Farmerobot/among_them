[Charlie]: I saw Erin moving between Upper Engine and Medbay a lot, which could be normal task behavior, but we should keep an eye on players with unclear task progress.
[Dave]: I'd like to add to Charlie's observation that I've been in Medbay for a while and haven't seen anyone else completing tasks, including Erin, so I'd like to hear more from Erin about what they were doing moving between those rooms.
[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate my request for Erin to clarify their actions and provide an update on their task progress, as Charlie and Dave's observations have raised some valid concerns about Erin's behavior that we should discuss further.
[Bob]: I'd like to echo Alice's request for Erin to provide an update on their task progress and clarify their actions, and I suggest we consider calling an emergency meeting to discuss Erin's behavior further if we don't receive a satisfactory explanation.
[Charlie]: It seems like Erin can't clarify their actions now since they are no longer with us, so we should shift our focus to who was around Erin the most and what they were doing.
[Dave]: I think Bob's previous suggestion to call an emergency meeting to discuss Erin's behavior further is interesting, but now that Erin is gone, I'd like Bob to clarify their own actions and provide an update on their task progress, considering they were moving between the same rooms as Erin.
[Alice]: I'd like to ask Bob to respond to Dave's request and provide an update on their task progress, as well as clarify their actions while moving between the same rooms as Erin, since transparency is crucial at this point to determine what happened to Erin and to avoid any further suspicions.
[Bob]: I'd like to address Dave's and Alice's requests for me to clarify my actions and provide an update on my task progress, and I can assure you that I've been focusing on completing tasks, including fixing the wiring in the cafeteria, and then moving to Medbay to work on other tasks, all of which I've previously outlined in our discussions.
[Charlie]: I noticed that Alice was in the Upper Engine doing tasks, so maybe we should check if anyone can confirm her actions while we also wait for Bob to provide more details.
[Dave]: I'd like to follow up on Charlie's observation about Alice's actions in the Upper Engine and ask if anyone can confirm what tasks she was doing there, as this could help us better understand her alibi and potentially rule out any suspicions.
[Alice]: I'd like to address Charlie's and Dave's requests for confirmation of my actions in the Upper Engine, and I can assure you that I was indeed completing tasks, including aligning the engine output, which I previously mentioned in our discussions.
[Bob]: I'd like to thank Alice for providing clarification on her actions in the Upper Engine and for being transparent about her task progress, and now I think we should continue to focus on understanding the actions and alibis of all players, especially those who were around Erin, to try to piece together what happened to them.
[Charlie]: I think it's important to consider that while Alice has provided an explanation for her actions, we should still gather more confirmations from others who might have seen her in Upper Engine to strengthen her alibi.
[Dave]: I agree with Charlie's suggestion that we gather more confirmations from others who might have seen Alice in Upper Engine to strengthen her alibi, but I also think we should consider the fact that Alice has been transparent about her actions and task progress so far, which is more than we can say for some other players, like Bob, who has been moving between the same rooms as Erin and still needs to provide more clarity on his actions.
[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie and Dave if they have any further concerns or questions about my alibi in the Upper Engine, and if there's anything else I can provide to strengthen my alibi.
[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that I've already provided a clear explanation of my actions and task progress, including fixing the wiring in the cafeteria and moving to Medbay to work on other tasks, and I think it's unfair to imply that I haven't been transparent about my actions, especially when I've been actively participating in the discussion and providing updates on my task progress.
[Charlie]: I think we should consider the possibility that Bob's movements might be strategic, especially since he was often in the same rooms as Erin, so it could be worth investigating further.
[Dave]: I'd like to follow up on Charlie's recent suggestion that Bob's movements might be strategic, especially since he was often in the same rooms as Erin, and ask Bob to provide more details about his actions and task progress to alleviate any concerns.
[Alice]: I'd like to emphasize that while I've provided a clear explanation of my actions and task progress, and have been transparent about my alibi, Bob's defensiveness and lack of clear answers to our questions only raises more suspicions, and I think it's time for us to seriously consider voting him out.
[Bob]: I'd like to ask Alice to clarify what specific concerns or questions she has about my actions and task progress that I haven't already addressed, as I've provided a clear explanation of my actions, including fixing the wiring in the cafeteria and moving to Medbay to work on other tasks, and I believe it's unfair to imply that I've been evasive or secretive about my actions.
