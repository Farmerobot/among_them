[Dave]: I'd like to hear from Erin about what she was doing in the medbay, and also, has anyone seen Charlie or Bob since the start of the round, it's getting a bit suspicious that they're MIA?
[Alice]: I saw Dave eliminate Charlie in the Cafeteria and then kill Erin in Medbay, which makes me strongly believe Dave is the impostor and we should vote him out immediately.
[Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria earlier with Dave, Erin, Alice, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks together, so Alice's claim seems highly suspicious and contradictory to what I directly observed.
[Dave]: I think it's interesting that Alice's story keeps changing, first, she didn't mention seeing me with Charlie in the cafeteria, and now she's claiming I killed Erin in the medbay, which contradicts Bob's eyewitness account, so I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her timeline and provide more details about what she supposedly saw.
[Alice]: I stand by my original statement that Dave eliminated Charlie in the Cafeteria and killed Erin in Medbay, and I'm confident in my observations despite Bob's contradictory claims, which seem designed to protect the real impostor.
[Bob]: I want to emphasize that Alice's accusation doesn't align with what I directly witnessed, and I'm willing to provide a detailed account of everyone's activities in the Cafeteria to help the team uncover the truth and prevent a potentially wrongful elimination.
[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that Alice's accusations against me remain unsubstantiated and contradict Bob's eyewitness account, which raises suspicions about her true intentions, and I believe we should focus on gathering more information from Bob's detailed account before making any rash decisions.
[Alice]: I want to challenge Bob directly by asking him to explain exactly what he was doing in the Cafeteria and provide precise details about the interactions between Charlie, Erin, Dave, and himself to expose any potential inconsistencies in his seemingly protective narrative.
[Bob]: I'm ready to provide a comprehensive, moment-by-moment breakdown of exactly what I observed in the Cafeteria, which will clearly demonstrate that Dave was doing tasks alongside Charlie, Erin, and Alice, and could not have been responsible for any eliminations during that time.
[Dave]: I think it's telling that Alice is now trying to scrutinize Bob's account, but she still hasn't provided any concrete evidence or witnesses to support her own claims, which continue to contradict Bob's eyewitness testimony and raise serious doubts about her credibility.
[Alice]: I want Bob to provide specific, verifiable details about the tasks each person was doing in the Cafeteria, including exact locations and task types, to validate his claim that everyone was working together harmoniously.
[Bob]: I saw Dave emptying the trash can near the east wall of the Cafeteria, while Erin was fixing wiring by the south entrance, Charlie was calibrating the distributor near the central table, and Alice was working on the download task - all of them were visibly engaged in legitimate tasks, which directly contradicts Alice's accusation that Dave eliminated anyone.
[Dave]: I want to thank Bob for providing a detailed account of everyone's activities in the Cafeteria, which further discredits Alice's unsubstantiated claims and raises suspicions about her motives.
[Alice]: I want to challenge Bob's detailed account by asking how he can be so certain about everyone's exact locations and tasks when the Cafeteria is a busy space, and why he seems so determined to protect Dave despite my clear testimony of witnessing Dave's eliminations of Charlie and Erin.
[Bob]: I will continue to provide precise, verifiable details about the Cafeteria events to demonstrate that Alice's accusations are baseless and that Dave could not have committed the eliminations she claims, as my moment-by-moment account clearly shows everyone was engaged in legitimate tasks during the time in question.
