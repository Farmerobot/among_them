[Bob]: I'd like to echo my previous question, has anyone seen Alice since the last round, and does anyone know what task she was working on before she disappeared?
[Charlie]: Bob, I saw you kill Alice in the cafeteria, so stop pretending you don't know where she is.
[Erin]: Charlie is right, I also saw Bob kill Alice in the cafeteria, so we should vote him out.
[Dave]: Bob, both Charlie and Erin confirm they saw you kill Alice in the cafeteria, just like I did, so there's no point denying it any longer.
[Bob]: It's suspicious that Charlie, Erin, and Dave all claim to have witnessed me killing Alice in the cafeteria, yet none of them reported it or called an emergency meeting until now, which suggests they might be coordinating their stories to frame me.
[Charlie]: Bob, we reported it as soon as we could, and it's absurd to think we'd coordinate a lie this elaborate; vote Bob.
[Erin]: Bob's trying to deflect blame, but three witnesses are hard to dismiss – let's vote him out and get back to tasks.
[Dave]: Bob, your attempt to paint us as colluding is desperate and illogical; why would three crewmates protect each other if one of us was the impostor?
[Bob]: I'd like to ask, if Charlie, Erin, and Dave are so convinced that they saw me kill Alice in the cafeteria, can they explain why none of them have mentioned anyone else being present in the cafeteria at the time, and whether they've found any actual evidence of Alice's body?
[Charlie]: Bob, if you're so concerned about evidence, why don't you explain how you knew Alice was dead before her body was reported?
[Erin]: Bob, your questions about other witnesses and the body are irrelevant distractions; three people saw you vent, so let's vote you out.
[Dave]: Bob, you're grasping at straws; three people saw you kill Alice, so just admit it and let's move on.
[Bob]: It's interesting that Charlie, Erin, and Dave continue to avoid answering my questions about the specifics of what they claim to have witnessed, and instead resort to personal attacks and demands for me to confess, which only adds to my suspicion that they might be hiding something.
[Charlie]: Bob, you asked where Alice was *after* you killed her – why?
[Erin]: Bob, you asked where Alice was *after* you killed her, just like Charlie said, so why are you still trying to deflect?
[Dave]: Bob, you asked where Alice was *after* you killed her, just like Charlie and Erin pointed out, so it's obvious you're the impostor.
[Bob]: It seems Charlie, Erin, and Dave are still refusing to provide actual evidence or answer my questions about their claims, and instead are choosing to selectively focus on my previous questions to try to paint me as guilty, which only further supports my suspicion that they are coordinating their accusations to frame me.
[Charlie]: Bob, your increasingly elaborate attempts to deflect blame only make you look more guilty, so let's just vote you out.
[Erin]: Bob, you asked where Alice was after you killed her, which proves you know she's dead and gives away your guilt.
[Dave]: Bob, stop wasting our time with these ridiculous deflections; we all saw you kill Alice, so just admit it and let's vote.
