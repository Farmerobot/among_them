[Bob]: I'd like to hear from Erin, Charlie, Dave, and Alice about their plans for the next round, and if anyone noticed anything unusual while we were all in the cafeteria together.
[Charlie]: I started the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I'm planning to head to the Medbay next to fix wiring and submit a scan; I didn't notice anything unusual, but let's stay vigilant.
[Dave]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria and plan to head to Admin next, so maybe we can form a group to cover each other as we move to our tasks.
[Alice]: I completed the task "Empty the cafeteria trash" and plan to head to Medbay next to start my scan task; sticking together in small groups could be a good idea for safety.
[Bob]: I think it's interesting that Dave was quick to suggest moving to a new location after reporting Erin's body, and I'd like to hear more about what he saw when he found her, was anyone else around, and did he notice anything unusual?
[Charlie]: Dave, could you give us more details about where exactly you found Erin's body and if there was anyone nearby when you discovered her?
[Dave]: I found Erin's body near the trash chute in the cafeteria, and at the time of discovery, Bob, Charlie, and Alice were present in the cafeteria with me, but I didn't notice anything unusual or anyone leaving hastily.
[Alice]: It seems odd that Erin ended up dead while working on the same task as Bob and me, so maybe someone was pretending to do a task nearby.
[Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice is trying to divert attention to someone pretending to do a task nearby, maybe she's trying to cover her own tracks, especially since she was working on the same task as Erin and me.
[Charlie]: Alice, you mentioned someone might have been pretending to do a task nearby; can you clarify why you suspect this, and if you noticed anyone acting suspiciously while you were doing the trash task?
[Dave]: Let's focus on gathering more information and observations from everyone, especially since we were all in the cafeteria together; did anyone see someone acting suspiciously or moving towards Erin before the body was found?
[Alice]: I was focused on completing the trash task alongside Bob and Erin, so I didn't notice anyone acting suspiciously at that moment, but Dave, did you see anyone lingering near the trash chute before we all dispersed?
[Bob]: I'd like to point out that Alice's latest response seems inconsistent with her previous statement, where she implied someone might have been pretending to do a task nearby, but now she's claiming she didn't notice anyone acting suspiciously while working on the trash task alongside Erin and me.
[Charlie]: Alice, considering your latest response, can you clarify your observations and why you initially suspected someone might have been pretending to do a task near the trash chute?
[Dave]: Bob, could you elaborate on what specifically seems inconsistent about Alice's statements, as understanding this might help us figure out what really happened to Erin?
[Alice]: Let's focus on the fact that we were all in the cafeteria together; it might be beneficial to review who moved where after we completed our tasks to identify any suspicious movements or patterns.
[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that Alice's statements seem inconsistent, and I think it's suspicious that she's trying to divert attention to reviewing who moved where after completing tasks, instead of addressing the inconsistencies in her own statements.
[Charlie]: It seems like there's a lot of focus on Alice's statements and potential inconsistencies, but we should carefully consider if those are significant enough to indicate suspicious behavior or if they might be a misunderstanding or oversight.
[Dave]: I think it's important to clarify the timeline and actions of everyone in the cafeteria; let's each recount our movements and tasks to see if any inconsistencies arise.
[Alice]: I understand the concern about my statements, but I was merely suggesting that the possibility of someone pretending to do a task shouldn't be dismissed; let's focus on clarifying the timeline of our movements in the cafeteria to identify any unusual behavior.
