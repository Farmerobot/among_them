[Erin]: I was just in Electrical and saw that one of the tasks was already completed, but I didn't see anyone around, does anyone know who might have done it?
[Alice]: I think it's worth investigating further, and since Erin was in Electrical and didn't see anyone, it's possible that the impostor might have used their ability to complete the task undetected, and we should discuss this possibility further.
[Bob]: I think it's essential that we investigate Alice's prolonged presence in Admin, as it seems suspicious that she's been waiting there for so long without contributing to the discussion or providing any concrete information, and we should ask her directly about her intentions to clear up any potential concerns.
[Erin]: I'd like to ask Alice directly: what were you doing in Admin for so long, and did you see or hear anything suspicious, as Bob's concerns about your prolonged presence there do seem valid and worth clarifying?
[Alice]: Given the recent developments and the concerns raised by Bob and Erin, I'd like to reassure everyone that I was indeed working on the wiring task in Admin, and I'm happy to provide more information about my actions and the environment in Admin, which might help alleviate any concerns and move us forward in our investigation.
[Bob]: Given the recent developments and the concerns raised, I think it's essential that we continue to share information and discuss our findings to ensure we're working together effectively to identify the impostor and complete our objectives, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss Alice's explanation and gather more information about the wiring task she was working on in Admin.
[Erin]: I'd like to address Bob's suggestion of holding an emergency meeting to discuss Alice's explanation, but before we do that, I think we should ask Charlie about their whereabouts and what tasks they've completed, as they were also in Medbay with me and I haven't seen them contribute to the discussion yet.
[Alice]: I think Erin's suggestion to ask Charlie about their whereabouts and tasks is a great idea, and I'd like to add that we should also ask Charlie about their alibi for the time when the task in Electrical was completed, as Erin's observation that no one was around when they saw the task completed is a crucial piece of information that we need to investigate further.
[Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie directly about their whereabouts and alibi for the time when the task in Electrical was completed, as Erin's observation that no one was around when she saw the task completed is a crucial piece of information that we need to investigate further.
[Erin]: I'd like to point out that Charlie still hasn't responded to our questions, and their silence is becoming increasingly suspicious, especially considering the importance of their alibi for the time when the task in Electrical was completed.
[Alice]: I think it's essential to keep the discussion going and ask Charlie directly about their whereabouts and alibi for the time when the task in Electrical was completed, as Erin's observation that no one was around when she saw the task completed is a crucial piece of information that we need to investigate further, and their prolonged silence is indeed raising more concerns.
[Bob]: I think it's time we take a closer look at Charlie's behavior and lack of response to our questions, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss their silence and gather more information about their whereabouts and alibi for the time when the task in Electrical was completed, as Erin's observation that no one was around when she saw the task completed is a crucial piece of information that we need to investigate further and Charlie's silence is only adding to the mystery.
[Erin]: I think it's interesting that Bob is so focused on Charlie's silence, maybe he's trying to distract us from his own suspicious behavior, and I'd like to ask Bob about his whereabouts during the time the task in Electrical was completed, since he's so interested in Charlie's alibi.
[Alice]: Given the recent developments and the concerns raised by Erin, I think it's essential to investigate Bob's alibi for the time when the task in Electrical was completed, as his prolonged interest in Charlie's silence and alibi is starting to raise more concerns and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss his silence and gather more information about his whereabouts and alibi for the time when the task in Electrical was completed.
