[Charlie]: I'm a little surprised that no one seems to be discussing the possibility of Dave being an impostor, considering he and Erin were together in the Upper Engine room for quite some time, and he didn't seem to report any suspicious activity from them.
[Dave]: That's a blatant lie, Charlie – I was in Medbay with Bob and Erin, and Bob can confirm I was with him while he ran diagnostics.
[Alice]: Dave, I saw Bob go into Medbay *after* he was with me and the others in Cafeteria, so you couldn't have been with him the whole time he was there.
[Bob]: Alice, I went straight to Medbay after the Cafeteria; are you sure you didn't see me head that way immediately after we left?
[Charlie]: I think it's worth pointing out that Bob's alibi seems shaky at best, and his repeated insistence that he was in Medbay immediately after the Cafeteria visit isn't entirely convincing, especially considering Alice's eyewitness account.
[Dave]: Alice, are you absolutely positive you saw Bob *after* he was with you in the Cafeteria? Could you have possibly seen him *before* we all left the Cafeteria and mistaken it for afterward?
[Alice]: Dave, I'm positive – I saw Bob enter Medbay *after* we were all together in the Cafeteria, and it seems like both you and Bob are changing your stories to fit the narrative, which is very suspicious.
[Bob]: Alice, I left the Cafeteria and went straight to Medbay; are you sure you aren't mistaken about the timing, as Dave and I were together there immediately afterward?
[Charlie]: I think it's essential to bring up the fact that Erin hasn't provided any concrete evidence to support Dave's alibi, and her silence is starting to raise more questions than answers, especially considering she was in the Upper Engine room with Dave for an extended period.
[Dave]: Alice, I understand your certainty, but are you absolutely sure you didn't see Bob heading towards Medbay *before* we all left the Cafeteria, perhaps while others were still finishing their snacks?
[Alice]: Dave, your repeated attempts to make me question my own memory are making you look even more suspicious.
[Bob]: Dave, as I asked before, do you remember when Erin joined us in Medbay, as that would corroborate our timelines and potentially clarify Alice's misunderstanding?
[Charlie]: I think it's crucial to investigate Erin's alibi further, as her silence is starting to make her look suspicious, and we need to consider the possibility that she might be an impostor, especially given her close association with Dave, who's already raising some red flags with his inconsistent alibis.
[Dave]: Bob, I was with you in Medbay when Erin arrived shortly after you, and her confirming this would clarify Alice's possible mistiming of seeing you leave the Cafeteria.
[Alice]: Erin, please tell us where you were and when, because your silence is making you look just as suspicious as Dave and Bob.
[Bob]: Erin, Alice claims she saw me enter Medbay after the Cafeteria; can you confirm when you joined Dave and me there to clarify this discrepancy?
[Charlie]: I think we should focus on Erin's alibi first and try to get a clear answer from her about her whereabouts before jumping to conclusions about Dave and Bob's suspicious behavior.
[Dave]: Erin, are you there? Please confirm you were with Bob and me in Medbay, this is crucial to clearing up this misunderstanding.
[Alice]: Erin, if you were in Medbay with Dave and Bob, *when* did you arrive?
[Bob]: Erin, if you were with Dave and me in Medbay, please tell us what time you arrived and what you saw us doing.
