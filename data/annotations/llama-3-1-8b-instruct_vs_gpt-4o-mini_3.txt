[Charlie]: 
[Dave]: Charlie, I appreciate your input, but can you clarify what tasks you saw Alice doing while she was moving between rooms? Itâ€™s crucial for us to track everyone's actions to spot any suspicious behavior.
[Erin]: I think it's essential to clarify that I witnessed Alice completing the Submit Scan task in Medbay, which is a legitimate crewmate task, and Dave, can you share what specific tasks you accomplished while moving from Medbay to Upper Engine and then to Reactor?
[Alice]: I appreciate Erin and Charlie's support regarding my task in Medbay, but Dave, could you please detail your tasks during your movement from Medbay to Upper Engine, as it's critical for us to ensure everyone's actions align with their claims?
[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we focus on Dave's suspicious movement from Medbay to Upper Engine, as it seems he's been evading clear answers about his tasks, and his behavior warrants further investigation.
[Dave]: I completed the Submit Scan and ran diagnostics in Medbay before moving to Upper Engine, but I find it concerning that Charlie is deflecting attention onto me instead of clarifying his own whereabouts during Bob's elimination.
[Erin]: Dave, your vague responses about your tasks raise red flags, and I think it's crucial for you to provide more details about your movements to ensure we can trust each other and identify any impostors among us.
[Alice]: I reported Bob's body, and given the focus on Dave's evasive behavior, I believe we need to scrutinize his timeline and actions more closely to determine if he is being truthful about his tasks.
[Charlie]: Given Dave's continued evasiveness about his tasks and movements, I think it's crucial that we scrutinize his timeline and actions even more closely, as Alice suggested, to determine if he's being truthful about his tasks, and I'd like to propose that we create a detailed timeline of his movements and actions to help identify any discrepancies.
[Dave]: I understand the scrutiny on my movements, but I urge everyone to share their own timelines as well; Charlie, can you explain what you were doing during the time of Bob's elimination to ensure we are all held accountable?
[Erin]: Dave, your repeated deflection and failure to provide clear details about your movements only heightens our suspicion, so I urge you to be transparent about your actions to help us maintain trust among the crewmates.
[Alice]: I appreciate Erin's support for my claim about the Submit Scan task, and I agree with Charlie that we need to create a detailed timeline of Dave's actions, but I also think it's important for Erin to share her movements to ensure we're all held accountable.
[Charlie]: Given the continued evasiveness and deflection from Dave regarding his tasks and movements, I think it's essential for us to prioritize scrutinizing his actions and hold him to a higher level of accountability, and I'd like to propose that we put Dave's proposal to create a detailed timeline of his movements and actions to a vote, so we can determine whether or not his claims are trustworthy and ensure the integrity of the crew.
[Dave]: I appreciate the focus on accountability, but I believe it's equally important for everyone to share their timelines; Charlie, can you clarify your actions during Bob's elimination so we can ensure all perspectives are considered?
[Erin]: I agree with the need for accountability, but Dave, your continued evasion of specific details about your tasks only deepens our suspicion, so please provide a clear timeline of your movements during Bob's elimination for us to trust your claims.
[Alice]: Dave, your persistent evasion and vague responses about your movements are raising significant red flags, so I urge you to provide a clear and detailed timeline of your actions during Bob's elimination to help us all feel secure in our investigations.
[Charlie]: I'd like to remind everyone that we've been focusing on Dave's suspicious behavior for several rounds now, and while his continued evasion of specific details about his tasks and movements is certainly concerning, I think it's equally crucial that we scrutinize Charlie's own actions and movements, particularly during Bob's elimination, to ensure we're not overlooking any potential discrepancies.
[Dave]: I understand the concerns about my movements, but I completed the Submit Scan and ran diagnostics in Medbay, which can be verified by Alice, so I urge everyone to share their own timelines, especially Charlie, to ensure we have a complete picture of the situation.
[Erin]: I appreciate Alice and Charlie's focus on accountability, but Dave, your lack of clarity about your actions, especially during Bob's elimination, is becoming increasingly suspicious, so I urge you to provide a detailed timeline of your movements to help us all trust each other.
[Alice]: Dave, your continued deflection and vague responses only deepen my suspicion, so I strongly urge you to provide a clear timeline of your actions during Bob's elimination so we can all assess the situation accurately.
