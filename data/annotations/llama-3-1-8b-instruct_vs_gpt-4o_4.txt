[Alice]: I'm glad we're all working together, and I think we should prioritize finishing the wiring task in the cafeteria, it's crucial we get it done efficiently.
[Charlie]: I saw Alice doing the Empty the Cafeteria Trash task, so she seems to be working on tasks as well, and I agree we should focus on completing the wiring tasks quickly.
[Bob]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, so we can check that off our list, and let's keep an eye on each other as we move to different rooms to complete our tasks.
[Erin]: I saw Alice, Bob, and Dave working on tasks in the Cafeteria, so it seems like we're all focused on getting things done efficiently.
[Alice]: I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit concerned about Dave's disappearance, and I think we should take a closer look at Charlie's alibi, since they were the last one to mention seeing Dave, and we don't know what they were doing in the Admin room.
[Charlie]: Bob, where exactly did you find Dave's body, as I was in Admin alone and didn't see him there at all?
[Bob]: I found Dave's body right by the coffee task station in the cafeteria, and since Charlie was the last to leave, it would be helpful to know what task you were doing in Admin.
[Erin]: Charlie, since you were the last to leave the cafeteria and didn't see Dave in Admin, can you clarify what task you were doing there, and if you noticed anyone else nearby?
[Alice]: I think we should focus on gathering more information about Dave's disappearance and Charlie's alibi, as it's crucial we understand what happened before we can move forward with our tasks and ensure everyone's safety on the ship.
[Charlie]: I was in the Admin room working on the wiring task, and since I didn't see Dave or anyone else there, we should focus on those who were in the cafeteria to gather more insights on his disappearance.
[Bob]: Let's verify if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin to confirm his alibi, and make sure the wiring task he mentioned is actually completed there.
[Erin]: Charlie, can anyone else confirm seeing you working on the wiring task in Admin, as verifying your alibi would help us understand the situation better?
[Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and gathering more information about their activities in the Admin room, as it's crucial we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.
[Charlie]: Bob, since you found Dave's body by the coffee task station, did you see anyone else leaving that area or acting suspiciously before discovering the body?
[Bob]: I did not see anyone else leaving the coffee task station area before discovering Dave's body, so we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and ensuring no one moved into the cafeteria unnoticed.
[Erin]: I agree with Alice that verifying Charlie's alibi is crucial, so if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin, please speak up.
[Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi by asking other players if they saw them in Admin, and if anyone has any information about Charlie's activities in the Admin room, please share it with us, as it's essential we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.
[Charlie]: Let's not forget that multiple people were in the Cafeteria, where Dave's body was found, so we should focus on anyone who was in that area and might have seen something suspicious.
[Bob]: Let's ensure we verify if the wiring task in Admin is completed, as this would help confirm Charlie's alibi and clarify their role in Dave's disappearance.
[Erin]: Has anyone been in Admin recently to confirm if the wiring task is completed, as that would help verify Charlie's alibi and bring us closer to understanding what happened to Dave?
