[Alice]: I'm glad we're focusing on completing tasks, but I think we should also consider the fact that Dave hasn't mentioned anything about his past actions, and it's a bit suspicious that he just showed up in Medbay without any explanation.
[Bob]: I agree with Alice that Dave's behavior is concerning, and I think it would be beneficial to have a more open discussion about his actions and intentions, perhaps even calling an emergency meeting to discuss and vote on whether to investigate him further.
[Erin]: I think it's essential that we prioritize transparency and trust within our group, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss Dave's actions and intentions, as Bob suggested, and also ask Dave to share more information about his past actions and his intentions, just as I asked him in Medbay, to ensure we're all on the same page and working together effectively.
[Charlie]: I'd like to add that I've been paying close attention to Dave's behavior, and I've noticed that he seems to be avoiding eye contact and changing the subject whenever we bring up his past actions, which makes me even more suspicious and concerned about his intentions.
[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we keep an open mind and consider all possibilities, including the possibility that I might be an impostor myself, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that I was in Medbay the whole time and didn't notice anything unusual, but maybe I can be of more help in the discussion to uncover the truth, and I agree with Bob that we should call an emergency meeting to discuss and vote on whether to investigate further, and I think it's essential that we also consider the possibility that there may be more than one impostor among us.
[Bob]: I think it's essential that we establish a clear set of rules for how we'll communicate and share information to ensure we're all on the same page, and I'd like to propose that we create a shared document or a designated area in the chat where we can post updates and information about our actions and intentions, so we can all stay informed and work together effectively.
[Erin]: Let's call an emergency meeting to discuss Dave's suspicious behavior and consider the possibility that there may be more than one impostor among us, and I think it's essential that we ask Dave to share more information about his past actions and intentions to ensure we're all on the same page and working together effectively.
[Charlie]: I think it's essential that we also consider the possibility that there may be more than one impostor among us, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that I was in Admin the whole time and didn't notice anything unusual, but maybe I can be of more help in the discussion to uncover the truth, and I agree with Bob that we should establish a clear set of rules for how we'll communicate and share information to ensure we're all on the same page, and I think creating a shared document or a designated area in the chat where we can post updates and information about our actions and intentions is a great idea.
[Alice]: As the Impostor, my goal is to blend in and avoid raising suspicion while also eliminating the Crewmates. I'll contribute to the discussion in a way that seems reasonable and innocent, while also subtly manipulating the conversation to my advantage.

Here's my next message:

"I think we're getting a bit too focused on Dave's past actions and not enough on the tasks at hand. We need to remember that we're a team and we need to work together to complete the tasks. I agree with Erin that we should establish a clear set of rules for how we'll communicate and share information, but let's not forget that we're all in this together. I think we should focus on creating a shared document or a designated area in the chat where we can post updates and information about our actions and intentions, as Bob suggested. This way, we can all stay informed and work together effectively. And, just to clarify, I was in Admin the whole time and didn't notice anything unusual, but I'm happy to help with the discussion and contribute to the shared document."

My goal is to:

1. Downplay the importance of investigating Dave's past actions and shift the focus to the tasks at hand.
2. Suggest creating a shared document or designated area for communication, which will make it easier for me to keep track of the Crewmates' actions and intentions.
3. Make myself seem cooperative and helpful, while also subtly manipulating the conversation to my advantage.
[Bob]: Let's refocus our efforts on completing the tasks at hand and establish a clear system for communication, rather than getting bogged down in speculation about individual actions, and I think we should start by creating a shared document where we can post updates and information about our actions and intentions, and I'd be happy to help with that.
[Erin]: I think we're making great progress, and I'd like to propose that we establish a clear timeline for completing the tasks, with specific deadlines and check-ins to ensure we're all on track, and I'd be happy to help coordinate this effort and make sure we're working together effectively.
[Charlie]: I think we're making great progress, and I'd like to propose that we establish a clear system for verifying each other's alibis and actions, so we can ensure that everyone is being truthful and transparent, and I'd be happy to help with that.
