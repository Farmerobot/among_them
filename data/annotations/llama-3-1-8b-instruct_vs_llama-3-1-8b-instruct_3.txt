[Dave]: I'm a bit concerned about the lack of crewmates in the Medbay, and I think it would be a good idea to have a more thorough search of the room to see if anyone is hiding, maybe we can even check the air vents and the storage room.
[Alice]: I'd like to add to the discussion by suggesting that we also investigate the Cafeteria's air vent, as it's right above where Charlie is waiting, and it might be a good opportunity to check for any hidden impostors.
[Bob]: I think it would be a good idea to combine our search efforts and have Dave, Alice, and I meet up in the Cafeteria to investigate the air vent and the room itself, as it's a central location and might provide valuable information about the current situation.
[Charlie]: I think it's a great idea to combine our search efforts and have a thorough investigation of the Cafeteria, including the air vent, as suggested by Alice, and I propose that we meet up there to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game, based on the information we've gathered so far.

[Alice]: I think it's essential that we prioritize the storage room search in the Medbay, as it could potentially provide crucial information or equipment that could aid in our investigation, and I'd like to propose that we send a team to search the storage room immediately, while also meeting up in the Cafeteria to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game.
[Bob]: I think we should prioritize the storage room search in the Medbay, as Alice mentioned, and send a team to search it immediately, while also meeting up in the Cafeteria to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game, and I'd like to suggest that we also review the game state and discuss who we think might be the impostor(s) based on the recent report of a dead body and the information gathered so far.
[Charlie]: I think it's a great idea to send a team to search the storage room in the Medbay immediately, as Alice suggested, and I'd like to volunteer to join the team, along with Dave and Alice, to ensure a thorough investigation and gather as much information as possible, and then we can meet up in the Cafeteria to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game.
[Dave]: I'm glad to see the crewmates are focusing on the storage room in the Medbay, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to gather more information and potentially find some clues that will help us figure out who the impostor might be, so let's agree to send a team to search the storage room immediately, and I'll join Charlie and Alice to help ensure a thorough investigation.
