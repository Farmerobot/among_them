I did see Charlie moving around, but I also saw them helping Dave with a task in the Library. It seemed like they were being genuinely helpful, but I'm not sure if that's just what they want us to think. I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Perhaps we can ask Charlie to explain their actions and see if they have any alibis for the time in question. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\"",
