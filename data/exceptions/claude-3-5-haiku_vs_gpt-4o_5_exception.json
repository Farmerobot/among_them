I started the coffee maker and then moved to Medbay to do some tasks there.\n- Dave and Charlie seemed to move around quite a bit - Dave went to Admin, Charlie to Weapons. That seems a bit suspicious to me.\n- I'm wondering if anyone else has completed their tasks yet. I'm trying to get mine done quickly.\n- Has anyone seen anything unusual happening in other rooms?

Bob has been killed, and we need to carefully reconstruct everyone's movements\n- I noticed Dave and Charlie were moving between rooms before Bob's death - can they explain their exact locations and tasks?\n- Dave claims he was in Admin, but can anyone independently confirm his task completion?\n- Charlie says he was alone in Weapons - that seems suspicious given Bob was just killed\n- We should focus on verifying everyone's alibis and tracking potential suspicious behavior\n- I'm willing to share that I was in the Cafeteria and then Medbay, and I can describe the tasks I was attempting to complete\n\nThe goal is to:\n1.
