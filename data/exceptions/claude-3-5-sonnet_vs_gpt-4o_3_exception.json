It might help us verify your story and narrow down our suspicions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in O2 to complete the \"Clean O2 Filter\" task, which is why I moved there after Weapons, and unfortunately, I didn't see anyone else during that time, but I'm focused on completing tasks to help us win.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The timing of Charlie's movements between Weapons and O2 perfectly aligns with when Erin's body was found in Medbay, and the fact that he keeps providing convenient excuses without any witnesses is extremely concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's consider voting Charlie out given the lack of verification for his whereabouts and the alignment of his movements with Erin's death in Medbay, unless anyone else can provide new information.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Bob's suggestion to consider Charlie for ejection is valid, given the lack of verification for his whereabouts and the suspicious timing of his movements aligning with Erin's death in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the suspicion, but it's crucial to verify everyone's whereabouts, not just mine, and consider who else might have been in the Medbay area around the time Erin was there.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The fact that Charlie keeps pushing us to look at \"who else\" might have been near Medbay when we have three people confirming each other's locations in Cafeteria just makes him even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that Charlie's movements remain unverified and align suspiciously with the timing of Erin's death, I believe we should vote to eject Charlie unless new evidence emerges.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Alice and Bob; Charlie's unverified movements and the timing with Erin's death are too suspicious to overlook, so I think we should vote to eject him unless new evidence comes up.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not overlook the possibility that someone in the Cafeteria could have quickly moved to Medbay after completing their tasks, and we need to ensure we aren't overlooking other potential suspects.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 9\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your role as an Impostor and the current situation, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.
