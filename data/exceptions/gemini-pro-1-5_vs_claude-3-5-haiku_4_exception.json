Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the game context and discussion history, here are my discussion points:\n\n- We've consistently asked Blue to provide details about their Medbay activities, and their continued silence is deeply concerning\n- I want to emphasize that while we're focusing on Blue, we shouldn't lose sight of our primary goal: completing tasks and protecting the crew\n- The group seems united in wanting more information from Blue about their exact movements during Dave's elimination\n- I noticed that multiple crew members (Bob, Alice, Charlie, and myself) have independently raised suspicions about Blue's lack of transparency\n- We should proceed carefully but firmly - Blue's refusal to explain their actions is making them look increasingly suspicious\n- My earlier observation about Charlie doing tasks in the Cafeteria remains a confirmed fact, which helps establish some crew member credibility\n- While we're investigating Blue, we should also continue working on our individual tasks to progress the game\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I saw Blue heading towards Medbay earlier, did anyone else see that?\n[Erin]: I can confirm Charlie was doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier, and I think we should ask Blue more about their movements in Medbay to understand what they were actually doing there.\n[Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's task in the Cafeteria and Erin's movement to Admin, and I believe we should carefully investigate Blue's actions in Medbay to ensure transparency.\n[Bob]: I saw Blue in Medbay and can confirm they were moving around, but I didn't directly observe them completing any specific tasks, so we should ask Blue to clarify their exact actions to help clear up any suspicions.\n[Charlie]: Blue hasn't offered a good explanation for their whereabouts, so I think they're still our primary suspect in Dave's death.\n[Erin]: I think we need to methodically investigate Blue's movements in Medbay and ask for a clear, step-by-step account of their actions around the time Dave was killed, while remaining open to other potential scenarios.\n[Alice]: I think we should directly ask Blue to provide a detailed account of their specific tasks and movements in Medbay to help clarify their actions and eliminate any lingering suspicions about their potential involvement in Dave's elimination.\n[Bob]: I agree with Alice and Erin that we need a detailed, step-by-step account from Blue about their exact movements and tasks in Medbay to determine whether their actions were legitimate or suspicious in relation to Dave's death.\n[Charlie]: Blue, can you tell us *exactly* which Medbay tasks you were doing and in what order \u2013 that would really help clear things up.\n[Erin]: I believe we should maintain a balanced approach by asking Blue for specific details while also remembering that we need to stay focused on completing our tasks and protecting each other as a team.\n[Alice]: I think Blue's continued silence about their precise Medbay tasks is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we need a clear explanation to ensure the safety of our remaining crew

have multiple witnesses (Charlie, Bob, and myself) who can confirm Blue was in Medbay but cannot confirm any specific task completion\n- Blue's continued silence, despite multiple direct requests to explain their actions, is increasingly concerning and suggests they may be trying to hide something\n- Our primary goal as crewmates is to protect the team, and Blue's behavior raises significant red flags about their potential involvement in Dave's elimination\n- I recommend we vote Blue out to ensure the safety of the remaining crew members and prevent potential further eliminations\n- While we want to be fair, Blue has had multiple opportunities to provide a clear account of their movements and has chosen not to do so, which further increases suspicion\n\nThese points align with my crewmate

Medbay, I think we need more information about their specific actions there\n- Charlie and Erin both seem to have clear, traceable movements, which makes them appear less suspicious at the moment\n\nThe key strategy here is to:\n- Provide transparent information about my own observations\n- Support the ongoing discussion about Blue's suspicious movement\n- Highlight the known,

mentioned he saw Blue moving around Medbay but didn't confirm task completion, which is a yellow flag\n- Charlie and Erin seem to be focusing their suspicion on Blue, but we should be thorough in our investigation\n- I suggest we ask Blue directly to provide a detailed account of their actions in Medbay, including specific tasks they might have been attempting to complete\n- We should also consider whether other players might have had opportunities to eliminate Dave that we haven't yet explored\n- As a crewmate, my priority is finding the truth and ensuring the safety of the remaining

I noticed Bob and I were both in Medbay, and I can confirm Bob was doing a legitimate task (submitting a scan), which adds credibility to our observations\n- We should ask Blue not just about their movements, but specifically about which tasks they claim to have completed in Medbay\n- Charlie's point about Blue not offering a clear explanation is concerning and increases my suspicion about their potential involvement\n- Even though we're focusing on Blue, we should remain open to the possibility that there might be other potential threats among us\n- Our team's unity and methodical investigation approach will be key to identifying any potential impostors and protecting our remaining crew members\n\nThe discussion points maintain Alice's crewmate objectives of:\n1.
