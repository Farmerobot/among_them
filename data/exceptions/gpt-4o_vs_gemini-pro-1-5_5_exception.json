Based on your current location and available actions, here is a strategic plan:\n\n1. **Pretend doing task: Fix wiring in O2** - Engage in a task to avoid suspicion if someone enters the room and to mimic crewmate behavior.\n\n2. **Move to location Weapons** - Change your location to search for potential crewmates in a new area since you're currently alone.\n\n3. **Wait in Weapons** - Assess the situation in Weapons. If another player enters, you can evaluate the opportunity to interact or eliminate based on the situation.\n\nThis plan aims to keep you active within the game without raising suspicion while presenting potential elimination opportunities.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
