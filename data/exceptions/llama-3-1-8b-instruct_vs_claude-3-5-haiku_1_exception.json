I'll make sure to keep an eye on her.\n- I've been doing my part by pretending to empty the cafeteria trash, but I think it's time for me to move to a more central location. I'll head to the Medbay and see if I can gather more information or find a vulnerable target.\n- I'm a bit concerned that we haven't had any reports of dead bodies yet. This could be a sign that the impostors are doing a good job of blending in, but it could also mean that we're not paying close enough attention to each other's actions.\n- I think we should have an emergency meeting to discuss our progress and identify any potential impostors. Let's work together to figure out who's trustworthy and who might be hiding something.", "I'm glad we're discussing the lack of reported dead bodies, but I think we should also consider the fact that Erin's sudden reappearance in the Medbay might be more suspicious than initially thought, and I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at her actions before we make any conclusions.", "Here are some discussion points I'd like to contribute as Charlie, an Impostor:\n\n- Discussion point 1\nI think we should be cautious of Erin's sudden reappearance in the Medbay, as it might be a sign of her being an Impostor. I'd like to propose that we keep a close eye on her and discuss her actions further.\n\n- Discussion point 2\nI'm not sure why Bob is defending Erin so strongly, especially since he didn't see her entire day. Maybe we should ask him for more information about his alibi when he was in the cafeteria with Erin.\n\n- Discussion point 3\nAlice's confirmation of Erin's tasks in Medbay and Upper Engine might be a red herring. As Impostors, we know how to fake tasks and make it seem like we're contributing to the game's objectives. We should be careful not to take her word for it.\n\n- Discussion point 4\nDave's defense of Erin seems unwarranted, especially since he's been seen moving to the Weapons room, which is a suspicious location.
