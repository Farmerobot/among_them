We need to determine who was near him during that time.\n  \n- **Marcin's Movements**: Marcin was the last player seen with Andrii before the elimination. We should closely examine his timeline from Cafeteria to Medbay.\n\n- **Mateusz's Alibi**: Mateusz claims he was alone in Admin during the elimination. We need to verify this and see if anyone can confirm his presence there.\n\n- **Dariusz's Observations**: Dariusz saw Andrii in Cafeteria and was in Medbay when the body was reported. His observations could help clarify the timeline.\n\n- **Focus on Marcin**: Given that Marcin was the last with Andrii, we should scrutinize his actions and see if they align with his claims of being in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay.\n\n- **Vasyl's Reporting**: As the one who reported the body, I urge everyone to consider my observations and intentions. I reported the body to ensure we could discuss and investigate the situation.\n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- **Round 1**: Started in Cafeteria.\n- **Round 2**: Saw Andrii doing a task in Cafeteria; Dariusz was also present.\n- **Round 3**: Witnessed Marcin eliminate Andrii in Medbay; Dariusz also moved to Medbay.\n- **Round 4-6**: Focused discussions on Marcin's actions and verifying Mateusz's alibi in Admin.\n\nYour name is Vasyl.

I saw Andrii doing a task there just before the elimination. We should clarify the timeline of events for all players involved.\n\n- **Vasyl's Actions**: Vasyl reported Andrii's body. We should consider why he was the one to report it and if he had any opportunity to eliminate Andrii himself.\n\n- **Mateusz's Alibi**: Mateusz claims he was alone in Admin during the elimination. We need to verify his movements and see if anyone can corroborate his story.\n\n- **Dariusz's Observations**: Dariusz mentioned seeing Andrii starting the coffee maker in Cafeteria. We should discuss if anyone else can confirm this and how it fits into the timeline.\n\n- **Focus on Impostor Behavior**: We should also consider how the impostor might act in this situation. If I were the impostor, I would want to deflect attention away from myself and create doubt about others.\n\n- **Vote Strategy**: We need to decide if we want to focus our votes on confirming Mateusz's alibi or if we should consider Vasyl's actions more closely, as he is directing suspicion towards me.\n\n### Impostor Observations to Share:\n- I was in Cafeteria before moving to Medbay.\n- I saw Andrii doing a task in Cafeteria just before the elimination.\n- Vasyl reported Andrii's body; we should question his motives.\n- Mateusz claims to have been alone in Admin; we need to verify this.\n- Dariusz saw Andrii in Cafeteria; we should confirm his timeline as well.\n\nYour name is Marcin.

He was actively completing tasks.\n  \n- **Vasyl's Reporting**: Vasyl reported Andrii's body in Medbay. We should consider why he was the one to report it and if he had any motive.\n\n- **Marcin's Timeline**: Marcin claims he was in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay. He was the last seen with Andrii, which raises suspicion.\n\n- **Mateusz's Alibi**: Mateusz states he was alone in Admin during the elimination. We need to verify his movements and see if anyone can confirm his presence there.\n\n- **Focus on Marcin**: Both Vasyl and Mateusz have pointed to Marcin's actions as suspicious. We should scrutinize his timeline closely to determine if he had the opportunity to eliminate Andrii.\n\n- **Next Steps**: We need to gather more information about Mateusz's and Marcin's movements to clarify their alibis before the vote. \n\n### Observations to Share:\n- Andrii was seen doing a task in Cafeteria before the elimination.\n- Vasyl and Marcin were present in Medbay when the body was reported.\n- There is a consensus to focus on Marcin's actions and verify Mateusz's alibi.\n\nYour name is Dariusz.
