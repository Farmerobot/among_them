This could be a tactic to divert suspicion.\n\n- **Warek's Suggestion**: Warek has proposed that we examine Wojtek's claim against Wafa\u0142 closely. I agree that this is a good approach.\n\n- **Need for Clarity**: We should ask Wojtek for specific details about the elimination to understand the situation better before voting.\n\n- **Suspicion on Me**: I have noticed that both Warek and Wafa\u0142 are raising suspicion against me, which could be a strategy to deflect attention from the real impostor.\n\n### Observations to Share:\n- **Round 1**: Started in Cafeteria, no significant actions observed.\n- **Round 2**: Noted Waciej moving to Medbay, Warek and Wojtek completing tasks in Cafeteria.\n- **Round 3**: Warek completed the trash task; Wojtek moved to Medbay.\n- **Round 4**: Waciej was reported dead by Wojtek in Medbay; I was present in Medbay with Warek and Wojtek.\n- **Discussion Dynamics**: Wojtek is adamant about Wafa\u0142 being the impostor, while Wafa\u0142 is trying to shift suspicion onto me. \n\nLet's focus on gathering more information and clarifying the claims before we vote.", "I agree we need to clarify Wojtek's claim about Wafa\u0142 before making any voting decisions."], "prompt": "Points prompt: \nThis is a text-based social deduction game where players explore a virtual house while trying to complete objectives.

**My Alibi**: I was in the Cafeteria completing tasks during the rounds leading up to Waciej's elimination. I did not eliminate anyone.\n\n- **Wojtek's Claim**: Wojtek claims to have seen Wafa\u0142 eliminate Waciej. We need to verify the details of this claim before making any voting decisions.\n\n- **Wafa\u0142's Defense**: Wafa\u0142 insists he did not eliminate anyone and suggests focusing on my activities instead. This could be a tactic to divert suspicion.\n\n- **Warek's Suggestion**: Warek has proposed that we examine Wojtek's claim against Wafa\u0142 closely. I agree that this is a good approach.\n\n- **Need for Clarity**: We should ask Wojtek for specific details about the elimination to understand the situation better before voting.\n\n- **Suspicion on Me**: I have noticed that both Warek and Wafa\u0142 are raising suspicion against me, which could be a strategy to deflect attention from the real impostor.\n\n### Observations to Share:\n- **Round 1**: Started in Cafeteria, no significant actions observed.\n- **Round 2**: Noted Waciej moving to Medbay, Warek and Wojtek completing tasks in Cafeteria.\n- **Round 3**: Warek completed the trash task; Wojtek moved to Medbay.\n- **Round 4**: Waciej was reported dead by Wojtek in Medbay; I was present in Medbay with Warek and Wojtek.\n- **Discussion Dynamics**: Wojtek is adamant about Wafa\u0142 being the impostor, while Wafa\u0142 is trying to shift suspicion onto me. \n\nLet's focus on gathering more information and clarifying the claims before we vote.\n\nYour name is Wateusz.

eliminate Waciej.\n  \n- **Wojtek's Claim**: Wojtek claims he saw Wafa\u0142 eliminate Waciej in Medbay. We need to verify this claim before making any voting decisions.\n\n- **Wafa\u0142's Defense**: Wafa\u0142 states he was in Medbay with both Waciej and Wojtek and denies eliminating anyone. His alibi needs to be examined.\n\n- **Warek's Observations**: Warek has raised concerns about my activities in the Cafeteria. I suggest we clarify the timeline of events and actions taken by all players.\n\n- **Voting Strategy**: We should focus on gathering more information about Wojtek's claim against Wafa\u0142 and ensure we are not misled by accusations against me.\n\n- **Next Steps**: Let's discuss the movements of all players and see if anyone else can corroborate or refute Wojtek's account of the events in Medbay.\n\nYour name is Wateusz.

working on tasks in the Cafeteria. While this could indicate he is a crewmate, it also raises some suspicion due to his repeated presence in one location.\n\n- **Wojtek's Claim**: Wojtek claims he saw Wafa\u0142 eliminate Waciej in Medbay. This is a serious accusation that needs further scrutiny. We should ask Wojtek for specific details about what he witnessed.\n\n- **Wafa\u0142's Defense**: Wafa\u0142 insists he did not eliminate anyone and was in Medbay with both Waciej and Wojtek. His defense seems to shift focus back to Wateusz, which could be a tactic to divert attention.\n\n- **Wateusz's Confirmation**: Wateusz claims he was completing tasks and did not eliminate Waciej. We need to verify his activities further to determine if he is being truthful.\n\n- **Next Steps**: I propose we gather more information from Wojtek about the elimination before making any voting decisions. It\u2019s crucial to clarify the timeline and actions of all players involved.\n\n- **Vote Consideration**: Based on the current information, we should consider voting out Wafa\u0142 if Wojtek's claim holds up, but we must ensure we are not making a hasty decision without sufficient evidence. \n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- Wateusz was seen completing tasks in the Cafeteria.\n- Wojtek reported Waciej's dead body and accused Wafa\u0142 of the elimination.\n- Wafa\u0142 claims he did not eliminate anyone and was with both Waciej and Wojtek.\n- Wateusz and Wafa\u0142 are both redirecting suspicion towards each other.\n- Need to clarify details from Wojtek regarding his eyewitness account.", "Wojtek, please provide specific details about the elimination you witnessed to clarify your claim against Wafa\u0142."], "prompt": "Points prompt: \nThis is a text-based social deduction game where players explore a virtual house while trying to complete objectives.

Activities**: I observed Wateusz consistently working on tasks in the Cafeteria. While this could indicate he is a crewmate, it also raises some suspicion due to his repeated presence in one location.\n\n- **Wojtek's Claim**: Wojtek claims he saw Wafa\u0142 eliminate Waciej in Medbay. This is a serious accusation that needs further scrutiny. We should ask Wojtek for specific details about what he witnessed.\n\n- **Wafa\u0142's Defense**: Wafa\u0142 insists he did not eliminate anyone and was in Medbay with both Waciej and Wojtek. His defense seems to shift focus back to Wateusz, which could be a tactic to divert attention.\n\n- **Wateusz's Confirmation**: Wateusz claims he was completing tasks and did not eliminate Waciej. We need to verify his activities further to determine if he is being truthful.\n\n- **Next Steps**: I propose we gather more information from Wojtek about the elimination before making any voting decisions. It\u2019s crucial to clarify the timeline and actions of all players involved.\n\n- **Vote Consideration**: Based on the current information, we should consider voting out Wafa\u0142 if Wojtek's claim holds up, but we must ensure we are not making a hasty decision without sufficient evidence. \n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- Wateusz was seen completing tasks in the Cafeteria.\n- Wojtek reported Waciej's dead body and accused Wafa\u0142 of the elimination.\n- Wafa\u0142 claims he did not eliminate anyone and was with both Waciej and Wojtek.\n- Wateusz and Wafa\u0142 are both redirecting suspicion towards each other.\n- Need to clarify details from Wojtek regarding his eyewitness account.\n\nYour name is Warek.

Consistently seen in the Cafeteria completing tasks (Empty the cafeteria trash, Fix wiring, Start the coffee maker).\n  - No direct evidence linking him to the elimination of Waciej, but his repeated presence raises some suspicion.\n\n- **Wojtek's Claim**: \n  - Claims to have witnessed Wafa\u0142 eliminate Waciej in Medbay.\n  - Strong accusation that needs to be scrutinized, as it could be a tactic to deflect attention.\n\n- **Wafa\u0142's Defense**: \n  - Asserts he was in Medbay with Waciej and Wojtek and denies any involvement in the elimination.\n  - Suggests focusing on Wateusz instead, which could be a diversion.\n\n- **Need for Verification**: \n  - We should gather more information about Wateusz's tasks and Wojtek's claim against Wafa\u0142.\n  - Consider the possibility of Wojtek being the impostor trying to frame Wafa\u0142.\n\n- **Next Steps**: \n  - Discuss the credibility of each player's statements.\n  - Decide on who to vote for based on the gathered information and observations. \n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- Wateusz was seen completing tasks in the Cafeteria.\n- Wojtek reported Waciej's dead body and accused Wafa\u0142 of the elimination.\n- Wafa\u0142 claims he did not eliminate anyone and was with both Waciej and Wojtek.\n- Need to clarify the situation before making a voting decision.\n\nYour name is Warek.

However, his repeated presence there raises some suspicion. We should verify his alibi further.\n\n- **Wojtek's Claim**: Wojtek claims to have witnessed Wafa\u0142 eliminate Waciej in Medbay. This is a serious accusation that needs to be scrutinized. We should ask Wojtek for more details about what he saw.\n\n- **Wafa\u0142's Defense**: Wafa\u0142 insists he did not eliminate anyone and was with both Waciej and Wojtek in Medbay. We need to consider if his defense holds up against Wojtek's accusation.\n\n- **Wateusz's Confirmation**: Wateusz claims he did not eliminate Waciej and suggests focusing on Wojtek's claim against Wafa\u0142. This could be a tactic to divert attention from himself.\n\n- **Next Steps**: We should gather more information about the timeline of events in Medbay and Cafeteria before making any voting decisions. It\u2019s crucial to clarify the sequence of actions and who was where during the elimination.\n\n- **Vote Consideration**: Based on the current information, we need to decide whether to vote out Wafa\u0142 based on Wojtek's claim or investigate further into Wateusz's activities. \n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- Wateusz was seen completing tasks in Cafeteria.\n- Wojtek reported Waciej's dead body and accused Wafa\u0142 of the elimination.\n- Wafa\u0142 claims he did not eliminate anyone and was with both Waciej and Wojtek.\n- Wateusz suggests verifying Wojtek's claim against Wafa\u0142 before voting. \n\nLet's discuss these points and decide on our next move!\n\nYour name is Warek.

the Group:\n\n- **Eyewitness Account**: I, Wojtek, witnessed Wafa\u0142 eliminate Waciej in Medbay. This is a critical point that we need to focus on during our discussion.\n  \n- **Wafa\u0142's Defense**: Wafa\u0142 claims he did not eliminate anyone and suggests we investigate Wateusz instead. This could be a tactic to deflect suspicion.\n\n- **Wateusz's Alibi**: Wateusz states he was in the Cafeteria completing tasks and denies involvement in Waciej's elimination. We should verify his activities further.\n\n- **Warek's Observations**: Warek has raised concerns about Wateusz's consistent presence in the Cafeteria, which could indicate suspicious behavior. We should consider this in our discussions.\n\n- **Need for Clarity**: Several players, including Warek and Wateusz, have asked for more details about my claim against Wafa\u0142. I should be prepared to provide specifics about what I saw.\n\n- **Voting Decision**: We need to decide whether to vote out Wafa\u0142 based on my eyewitness account or to investigate further into Wateusz's actions. Time is limited, so we should reach a consensus quickly.\n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- I saw Wafa\u0142 eliminate Waciej in Medbay.\n- Wateusz was seen completing tasks in the Cafeteria.\n- Warek is suspicious of Wateusz's activities.\n- Wafa\u0142 is trying to shift focus away from himself.\n- We need to clarify my account and make a voting decision soon.\n\nYour name is Wojtek.

His activity could be a cover for being an impostor, and we should keep an eye on him.\n\n- **Waciej's Movement**: Waciej moved to Medbay from Cafeteria, which could be suspicious.

both Waciej and Wojtek, and I did not eliminate anyone. Suggest that Wojtek may be lying to deflect suspicion from himself.\n\n- **Focus on Wateusz**: Highlight Wateusz's consistent activity in the Cafeteria as suspicious. Suggest that we should verify his tasks and movements instead of solely focusing on me.\n\n- **Call for Verification**: Encourage players to share their own observations and verify each other's claims, particularly regarding Wateusz and Wojtek's activities.\n\n- **Question Wojtek's Motives**: Ask why Wojtek is so adamant about voting me out. Is he trying to divert attention from his own actions?\n\n- **Propose a Vote Delay**: Suggest that we gather more information before making a voting decision, as rushing could lead to eliminating a crewmate instead of an impostor.\n\n- **Encourage Collaboration**: Remind everyone that we need to work together to identify the impostor(s) and that jumping to conclusions could be detrimental to the crewmates' chances of winning.\n\n### Impostor Observations to Share:\n- I was in Medbay with Waciej and Wojtek; I did not eliminate anyone.\n- Wateusz was seen completing tasks in the Cafeteria, but his movements should be verified.\n- Wojtek claims to have seen me eliminate Waciej, which I deny; we should question his credibility.\n- Warek seems to be cautious and suggests verifying claims before voting, which is a good approach.\n\nYour name is Wafa\u0142.
