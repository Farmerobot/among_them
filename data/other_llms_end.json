This is a clear indication of suspicious behavior, and we should consider this strongly during the vote.\"\n\n2. **Corroboration with Nemo:**\n   - \"Nemo was present with me in both the Cafeteria and Medbay. Nemo, can you confirm that we were together and if you noticed any suspicious actions from Lolek?\"\n\n3. **Task Verification:**\n   - \"Nemo and I were able to verify each other's tasks in the Cafeteria and Medbay. This provides us with an alibi for those rounds.\"\n\n4. **Lolek's Defense:**\n   - \"Lolek claims he was assisting Mateusz with a task and denies any wrongdoing. However, this does not explain why I saw him eliminate Mateusz.\"\n\n5. **Norbert's Isolation:**\n   - \"Norbert has been alone in Admin for the duration of the game and has not been able to witness any interactions or eliminations. Norbert, can you provide any additional information or observations from your time in Admin?\"\n\n6. **Call for Action:**\n   - \"Given the evidence at hand, we need to vote based on what we know. Lolek's actions have been directly observed by me, and unless there is concrete evidence to the contrary, we should vote to eject Lolek from the game to protect the remaining crewmates.\"\n\n7. **Request for Additional Information:**\n   - \"I encourage everyone to share their observations and any evidence that could either support or refute the claims made. It's crucial that we communicate openly to identify the impostor.\"\n\n8. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - \"We should vote based on the evidence presented. If anyone has information that can shed light on the situation or exonerate Lolek, now is the time to present it. Otherwise, we must act on the information we have to ensure the safety of the crew.\"\n\nBy focusing on these points, Wojtek can guide the discussion towards a resolution, encouraging players to share their observations and vote according to the evidence presented. It's important to maintain a calm and logical approach to persuade others and ensure the impostor is identified and ejected from the game.\n\nYour name is Wojtek.
