Pretend to do a task in the Cafeteria to appear innocent\n   - I'll choose \"Fix wiring in cafeteria\" as this is a common task that won't raise suspicion\n   - This helps establish my credibility as a seemingly cooperative crewmate\n\n2. Move to a different location with potential strategic value\n   - I'll move to Medbay, which is often a high-traffic area where I can observe other players\n   - Moving allows me to gather information and potentially find an opportunity to eliminate a crewmate\n\n3.

Move to Medbay\n   - This follows my previous strategy of exploring high-traffic areas\n   - Medbay was recently visited by Charlie and Erin, so there might be opportunities to gather information or find an isolated target\n\n2. Continue to maintain my cover by pretending to do a task in Medbay\n   - If possible, I'll pretend to do a task that blends in with typical crewmate behavior\n   - This helps reinforce the perception that I'm a legitimate crewmate\n\n3. Observe player movements and interactions in Medbay\n   - Track which players enter and leave the room\n   - Look for potential opportunities to isolate and eliminate a crewmate\n   - Stay alert for moments when I can act without raising suspicion\n\n4. Be prepared to adapt my strategy based on who I encounter\n   - If a suitable elimination opportunity doesn't present itself, I'll focus on gathering more information\n   - Maintain a low profile and continue to act like a cooperative crewmate\n\nThe plan prioritizes strategic positioning, maintaining my cover, and creating opportunities to reduce the number of crewmates.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
