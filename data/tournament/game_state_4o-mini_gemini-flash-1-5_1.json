We need a clear timeline from Mateusz, Lolek, and Nemo of their movements in and around Medbay before and after the death.  Inconsistencies should be highlighted.\n\n* **Mateusz's Deflection:** Mateusz consistently tries to shift suspicion to Lolek and me. This is a suspicious tactic.  Let's not be distracted.\n\n* **Cafeteria Activity:** While the Cafeteria activity is relevant, it's secondary to establishing the Medbay timeline.  Once we have a clear picture of Medbay, we can revisit the Cafeteria events.\n\n* **Verify Alibi:**  We need concrete alibis from everyone who was near Medbay.  Vague statements are insufficient.

Mateusz's repeated attempts to shift focus to the Cafeteria are suspicious.\n\n* **Cafeteria Activity:** While the Medbay timeline is crucial, we shouldn't completely ignore the Cafeteria activity.  Norbert and I were both there, and we can corroborate each other's accounts.\n\n* **Mateusz's Behavior:** Mateusz's insistence on investigating the Cafeteria, despite the strong evidence pointing to Medbay, is a red flag.  Let's press him for a detailed and verifiable account of his time in Medbay.\n\n* **Next Steps:**  Let's get clear alibis from everyone regarding Medbay, then revisit the Cafeteria activity if necessary.

We can investigate this further once we have a clearer picture of what happened in Medbay.\n\n* **Mateusz's Deflection:** Mateusz's attempt to shift suspicion onto Norbert and Lolek is a clear sign of deception.

We need a detailed account of his movements before and after the elimination.  His attempts to deflect blame onto Norbert and Lolek are also suspicious.\n\n* **Verify Medbay Alibi:**  Let's prioritize verifying the alibis of everyone present in Medbay around the time of Wojtek's death before discussing Cafeteria events.  This includes Mateusz, myself, and Lolek.\n\n* **Cafeteria Activity Secondary:** While Norbert and Lolek's actions in the Cafeteria are noteworthy,  verifying the Medbay timeline should take precedence.  We can investigate the Cafeteria activity after we have a clearer picture of what happened in Medbay.\n\n* **Coordinate Information:**  We need to compare our individual accounts of events in both Medbay and the Cafeteria to identify inconsistencies and potential lies.\n\nThe discussion is cyclic, with each player speaking one by one in turn.

This location can also provide opportunities for stealthy eliminations if a crewmate is present.\n\n2. **Pretend to Do Task**: Once in Medbay, pretend to perform a task (e.g., \"Start the coffee maker\" or \"Fix wiring\"). This will help maintain your cover as a crewmate and build trust with others.\n\n3. **Observe for Opportunities**: While pretending to do the task, keep an eye out for any crewmates entering the room.

Their movements could provide crucial context.\"\n- **Defend my actions**: \"I was busy pretending to fix wiring in Medbay when Wojtek was eliminated. I can detail my movements if needed.\"\n- **Encourage verification**: \"Let's verify everyone's alibis, especially those who were in Cafeteria, to ensure we have a complete picture.\"\n\nThe discussion is cyclic, with each player speaking one by one in turn.
