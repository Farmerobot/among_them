However, please note that the following steps represent a general plan and do not represent your current options:\n**Plan for Wojtek (Crewmate)**\n\n1. **Complete Task**: Submit scan in Medbay. This is a critical task that will help progress towards the overall objective and can also provide information to other players if they witness you completing it.\n\n2. **Assess Situation**: After submitting the scan, take a moment to observe the room for any other players or potential discussions. If there are players present, engage them in conversation to gather information about their actions and any suspicions they may have.\n\n3. **Plan Next Move**: Depending on the outcome of the scan and the presence of other players, decide whether to stay in Medbay for further discussions or move to Upper Engine to check on your catalyzer task.\n\nThis plan focuses on completing your immediate task while remaining aware of the social dynamics of the game.\n\nAvailable Actions:\nNow, please choose only one of the actions listed below that best aligns with your planned objective. These are the actions you can actually perform right now:\n- wait in Medbay\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- complete task: Submit scan in medbay\n\nSelect one action from this list and respond with exactly that action as it is written.
