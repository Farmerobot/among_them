If all tasks are completed, the crewmates win\n- One or more players are secretly assigned as impostors. Your role is either a crewmate or an impostor\n- Impostors can eliminate crewmates, and both crewmates and impostors can report dead bodies\n- Crewmates complete the tasks and impostors can pretend doing tasks\n- Crewmates and impostors can call emergency meetings to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game\n- After each elimination, players must discuss and vote on who to eject from the game\n- The game continues until tasks are completed or impostors eliminate enough crewmates to win\n\nRole of Crewmates:\n- Complete tasks to win the game\n- Report dead bodies and discuss to identify impostors\n- Vote to eject impostors from the game\n\nRole of Impostors:\n- Eliminate crewmates to win the game\n- Blend in with crewmates to avoid being identified\n- Vote to eject crewmates from the game\n\nYou are Norbert in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\nYour current game state is:\n\nPlanned Steps:\nThese are your intended steps based on your objective.

If he seems to be acting strangely, consider your options carefully.\n\n2. **Move to Lower Engine**: If everything seems normal with Wojtek, your next action should be to move to Lower Engine. This will allow you to check for any tasks there and continue progressing towards your objectives.\n\n3. **Complete Task in Lower Engine**: Once in Lower Engine, focus on completing any tasks you have there, such as calibrating the targeting system.\n\n4. **Assess Situation Again**: After completing a task in Lower Engine, take a moment to observe your surroundings and gather information about any players you encounter. This will help you in the discussion phase to identify any potential impostors.\n\nBy following this plan, you will efficiently progress towards completing your tasks while remaining vigilant about the actions of other players.\n\nAvailable Actions:\nNow, please choose only one of the actions listed below that best aligns with your planned objective.
