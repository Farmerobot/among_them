This helps maintain your cover and prepares you for the next phase of your strategy.\n\n3. **Pretend Doing Task: Clean the Floor in Cafeteria (if safe):**\n   - **Rationale:** Once in Cafeteria, pretend to do a task to blend in with any crewmates who might enter.

This can help in planning eliminations and avoiding detection.\n\n2. **Pretend Doing Task: Fix Wiring in Admin:**\n   - Rationale: By pretending to do a task, you can blend in with crewmates and reduce suspicion. This also gives you an opportunity to observe other players and potentially find a moment to eliminate a crewmate.\n\n3. **Wait in Admin:**\n   - Rationale: After pretending to do a task, waiting in Admin allows you to see if any crewmates enter the room alone, providing an opportunity for elimination. Additionally, it gives you time to assess the situation and decide on your next move.\n\n4. **Move to Location Medbay (if safe):**\n   - Rationale: If the situation in Admin becomes too risky or if you have successfully eliminated a crewmate, moving to Medbay can help you avoid suspicion and prepare for the next phase of your plan.\n\nThis plan focuses on maintaining your cover as an impostor while positioning yourself strategically for potential eliminations.

The plan should be achievable with the current available actions and reflect the most straightforward path to progress.\n\n* Prioritize progression: Focus on advancing to new objectives.\n* Limit the plan to 3-4 steps to maintain focus on the current situation.\n* Adapt based on previous rounds: Review actions and plans from prior rounds and adjust your strategy.\n\nNext steps:\n\n\nAction prompt:\nThis is a text-based social deduction game where players explore a virtual house while trying to complete objectives. The game has two phases:\n1. Action Phase: Players can move between rooms and perform actions\n2. Discussion Phase: Players share information and vote on who to remove from the game\n\nKey Game Elements:\n- Players can move between rooms\n- Tasks need to be completed to win. If all tasks are completed, the crewmates win\n- One or more players are secretly assigned as impostors. Your role is either a crewmate or an impostor\n- Impostors can eliminate crewmates, and both crewmates and impostors can report dead bodies\n- Crewmates complete the tasks and impostors can pretend doing tasks\n- Crewmates and impostors can call emergency meetings to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game\n- After each elimination, players must discuss and vote on who to eject from the game\n- The game continues until tasks are completed or impostors eliminate enough crewmates to win\n\nRole of Crewmates:\n- Complete tasks to win the game\n- Report dead bodies and discuss to identify impostors\n- Vote to eject impostors from the game\n\nRole of Impostors:\n- Eliminate crewmates to win the game\n- Blend in with crewmates to avoid being identified\n- Vote to eject crewmates from the game\n\nYou are Nemo in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\nYour current game state is:\n\nPlanned Steps:\nThese are your intended steps based on your objective. However, please note that the following steps represent a general plan and do not represent your current options:\n### Short Plan for Next Steps\n\n1. **Complete Task in Admin**: Start by completing the task to **Fix wiring in admin**. This is a straightforward task that will help you progress towards winning the game by completing objectives.\n\n2. **Assess Situation**: After completing the wiring task, take a moment to observe Norbert and Mateusz. Pay attention to their actions and any discussions they may initiate, as this could provide clues about their roles.\n\n3. **Decide Next Move**: Based on your observations, decide whether to stay in Admin to gather more information or move to another location (like Cafeteria or Storage) to continue working on your tasks.\n\nBy following this plan, you will efficiently complete your objectives while remaining vigilant for any signs of impostors.\n\nAvailable Actions:\nNow, please choose only one of the actions listed below that best aligns with your planned objective. These are the actions you can actually perform right now:\n- wait in Admin\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- move to location Storage\n- complete task: Clean the floor in admin\n- complete task: Fix wiring in admin\n\nSelect one action from this list and respond with exactly that action as it is written.
