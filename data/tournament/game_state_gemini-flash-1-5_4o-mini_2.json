Your role is either a crewmate or an impostor\n- Impostors can eliminate crewmates, and both crewmates and impostors can report dead bodies\n- Impostors win when there is only one crewmate left\n- Crewmates complete the tasks and impostors can pretend doing tasks\n- Crewmates and impostors can call emergency meetings to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game\n- After each elimination, players must discuss and vote on who to eject from the game\n- The game continues until tasks are completed or impostors eliminate enough crewmates to win\n\nRole of Crewmates:\n- Complete tasks to win the game\n- Report dead bodies and discuss to identify impostors\n- Vote to eject impostors from the game\n\nRole of Impostors:\n- Eliminate crewmates to win the game (until there is only on crewmate left)\n- Blend in with crewmates to avoid being identified\n- Vote to eject crewmates from the game\n\nYou are Mateusz in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Impostor\nYour current game state is:\n\nPlanned Steps:\nThese are your intended steps based on your objective. However, please note that the following steps represent a general plan and do not represent your current options:\nNext steps:\n\n1. **Attempt Elimination:**  Immediately attempt to eliminate one of the crewmates (Nemo or Lolek) in Medbay.  Prioritize the one who seems less observant or less likely to have noticed your presence.  If an opportunity doesn't present itself immediately, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Wait and Observe:** If elimination isn't possible, continue waiting in Medbay to observe crewmate behavior and look for another opportunity.  Their movements might reveal a moment of isolation.\n\n3. **Move to Cafeteria (if no opportunity):** If no elimination opportunity arises within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., a few turns), move to the Cafeteria.  The higher traffic in the Cafeteria might create more opportunities for elimination or at least allow for observing crewmate interactions.\n\n4. **Pretend to do a task (if in Cafeteria):** If in the Cafeteria and still no elimination opportunity, pretend to do a task (\"pretend doing task: Fix wiring in medbay\" \u2013 even though it's not in the cafeteria, it's a believable action) to maintain a believable alibi.\n\nAvailable Actions:\nNow, please choose only one of the actions listed below that best aligns with your planned objective.

This establishes a believable presence.\n\n2. **Move to Medbay:** Medbay is a high-traffic area where crewmates often congregate. This increases the chance of a successful elimination opportunity.\n\n3. **Eliminate a crewmate (if opportunity arises):**  In Medbay, look for an isolated crewmate. If an opportunity presents itself to eliminate a crewmate without being seen, do so.\n\n4. **Wait and Observe:** If no opportunity arises in Medbay, wait and observe the movements of other players.  This allows for planning the next move based on their actions and locations.\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\n\nRound 2\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Norbert moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Nemo moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Lolek moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nPlayers in room with you: [Norbert, Nemo, Lolek]\nYour plan:\nNext steps:\n\n1. **Wait in Medbay:** Observe crewmate movements and look for an isolated target for elimination.  This is the highest-priority action given the current location and objective.\n\n2. **Eliminate a crewmate (if opportunity arises):** If a crewmate enters Medbay alone, eliminate them.  Prioritize eliminating the crewmate who seems least suspicious based on observed actions (e.g., if one crewmate was seen doing multiple tasks, they might be less suspicious).\n\n3. **If no elimination opportunity:** If no one enters Medbay alone, move to the Cafeteria. The Cafeteria has a higher chance of crewmate interaction, increasing the likelihood of a successful elimination.\n\n4. **Pretend to do a task (if in Cafeteria):** If in the Cafeteria and no elimination opportunity presents itself, pretend to do a task to maintain a believable alibi.\nYour action: wait in medbay\nObservations:\n\nRound 3\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Norbert moved to Upper Engine from Medbay when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Nemo doing task Fix wiring in medbay when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Lolek doing task Submit scan in medbay when you were in Medbay\nPlayers in room with you: [Lolek]\nYour plan:\nNext steps:\n\n1. **Attempt Elimination:**  Immediately attempt to eliminate one of the crewmates (Nemo or Lolek) in Medbay.  Prioritize the one who seems less observant or less likely to have noticed your presence.  If an opportunity doesn't present itself immediately, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Wait and Observe:** If elimination isn't possible, continue waiting in Medbay to observe crewmate behavior and look for another opportunity.  Their movements might reveal a moment of isolation.\n\n3. **Move to Cafeteria (if no opportunity):** If no elimination opportunity arises within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., a few turns), move to the Cafeteria.  The higher traffic in the Cafeteria might create more opportunities for elimination or at least allow for observing crewmate interactions.\n\n4. **Pretend to do a task (if in Cafeteria):** If in the Cafeteria and still no elimination opportunity, pretend to do a task (\"pretend doing task: Fix wiring in medbay\" \u2013 even though it's not in the cafeteria, it's a believable action) to maintain a believable alibi.\nYour action: eliminate nemo\nObservations:\n\nRounds 4-5\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\nreport: Lolek reported a dead body\ndead_players: Dead players found: [Nemo]\nchat: Discussion: [Lolek]: I agree, Mateusz's presence during Nemo's elimination raises serious concerns, and we should definitely consider voting him out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Mateusz]: Lolek, you were busy with a task; you couldn't have seen everything.\nchat: Discussion: [Wojtek]: I understand your concerns, Lolek, but we should also consider that Mateusz was with us during the earlier tasks, which might indicate he\u2019s not the impostor; let\u2019s focus on gathering more evidence before making a decision.\nchat: Discussion: [Norbert]: I think we should also consider Lolek's actions during the elimination; his quick accusation of Mateusz could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Lolek]: I understand your point, Wojtek, but the evidence against Mateusz is strong, and we can't ignore the fact that I witnessed him eliminate Nemo directly.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Mateusz]: Lolek, your focus on your task makes your observation questionable; let's examine other possibilities.\nchat: Discussion: [Wojtek]: I appreciate everyone's input, but we should also consider that I was alone in Admin and Storage, which could help us narrow down the suspects further; let's keep discussing before we make a decision.\n\n\nThe discussion is cyclic, with each player speaking one by one in turn.

My defense hinges on discrediting his observation, highlighting the possibility of his own involvement or misinterpretation due to task focus.\n\n* **Establishing Alibi:**  I need to reinforce my presence during earlier tasks (as noted by Wojtek) to create reasonable doubt about my constant presence in Medbay.\n\n* **Shifting Suspicion:**  Norbert's suggestion to consider Lolek's actions is beneficial.  I should subtly encourage this line of questioning to divert attention away from myself.\n\n* **Strategic Voting:**  My priority is to avoid being voted out.  If it seems inevitable, I should try to vote out Lolek, as he is the most vocal accuser.  If the vote is close, I might consider voting for Wojtek to create further chaos and division.\n\n* **Future Actions:**  I need to be more cautious in my eliminations.  Choosing less-observed locations and times is crucial for future success.  I should also focus on observing Lolek and Wojtek's movements to identify potential weaknesses in their alibis.\n\nThe discussion is cyclic, with each player speaking one by one in turn.

This establishes a believable presence.\n\n2. **Move to Medbay:** Medbay is a high-traffic area where crewmates often congregate. This increases the chance of a successful elimination opportunity.\n\n3. **Eliminate a crewmate (if opportunity arises):**  In Medbay, look for an isolated crewmate. If an opportunity presents itself to eliminate a crewmate without being seen, do so.\n\n4. **Wait and Observe:** If no opportunity arises in Medbay, wait and observe the movements of other players.  This allows for planning the next move based on their actions and locations.\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\n\nRound 2\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Norbert moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Nemo moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Lolek moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nPlayers in room with you: [Norbert, Nemo, Lolek]\nYour plan:\nNext steps:\n\n1. **Wait in Medbay:** Observe crewmate movements and look for an isolated target for elimination.  This is the highest-priority action given the current location and objective.\n\n2. **Eliminate a crewmate (if opportunity arises):** If a crewmate enters Medbay alone, eliminate them.  Prioritize eliminating the crewmate who seems least suspicious based on observed actions (e.g., if one crewmate was seen doing multiple tasks, they might be less suspicious).\n\n3. **If no elimination opportunity:** If no one enters Medbay alone, move to the Cafeteria. The Cafeteria has a higher chance of crewmate interaction, increasing the likelihood of a successful elimination.\n\n4. **Pretend to do a task (if in Cafeteria):** If in the Cafeteria and no elimination opportunity presents itself, pretend to do a task to maintain a believable alibi.\nYour action: wait in medbay\nObservations:\n\nRound 3\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Norbert moved to Upper Engine from Medbay when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Nemo doing task Fix wiring in medbay when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Lolek doing task Submit scan in medbay when you were in Medbay\nPlayers in room with you: [Lolek]\nYour plan:\nNext steps:\n\n1. **Attempt Elimination:**  Immediately attempt to eliminate one of the crewmates (Nemo or Lolek) in Medbay.  Prioritize the one who seems less observant or less likely to have noticed your presence.  If an opportunity doesn't present itself immediately, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Wait and Observe:** If elimination isn't possible, continue waiting in Medbay to observe crewmate behavior and look for another opportunity.  Their movements might reveal a moment of isolation.\n\n3. **Move to Cafeteria (if no opportunity):** If no elimination opportunity arises within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., a few turns), move to the Cafeteria.  The higher traffic in the Cafeteria might create more opportunities for elimination or at least allow for observing crewmate interactions.\n\n4. **Pretend to do a task (if in Cafeteria):** If in the Cafeteria and still no elimination opportunity, pretend to do a task (\"pretend doing task: Fix wiring in medbay\" \u2013 even though it's not in the cafeteria, it's a believable action) to maintain a believable alibi.\nYour action: eliminate nemo\nObservations:\n\nRounds 4-7\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\nreport: Lolek reported a dead body\ndead_players: Dead players found: [Nemo]\nchat: Discussion: [Lolek]: I agree, Mateusz's presence during Nemo's elimination raises serious concerns, and we should definitely consider voting him out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Mateusz]: Lolek, you were busy with a task; you couldn't have seen everything.\nchat: Discussion: [Wojtek]: I understand your concerns, Lolek, but we should also consider that Mateusz was with us during the earlier tasks, which might indicate he\u2019s not the impostor; let\u2019s focus on gathering more evidence before making a decision.\nchat: Discussion: [Norbert]: I think we should also consider Lolek's actions during the elimination; his quick accusation of Mateusz could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Lolek]: I understand your point, Wojtek, but the evidence against Mateusz is strong, and we can't ignore the fact that I witnessed him eliminate Nemo directly.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Mateusz]: Lolek, your focus on your task makes your observation questionable; let's examine other possibilities.\nchat: Discussion: [Wojtek]: I appreciate everyone's input, but we should also consider that I was alone in Admin and Storage, which could help us narrow down the suspects further; let's keep discussing before we make a decision.\nchat: Discussion: [Norbert]: I think we should also consider Wojtek's alibi of being alone in Admin and Storage; it might help us narrow down our suspects further.\nchat: Discussion: [Lolek]: I appreciate everyone's input, but we must act on the clear evidence I have against Mateusz; I witnessed him eliminate Nemo directly, and we can't let that go unaddressed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Mateusz]: Lolek, your claim is unsubstantiated;  consider the possibility of misidentification given your task focus.\nchat: Discussion: [Wojtek]: I think we should take a moment to reflect on Lolek's strong accusation against Mateusz and consider if there are any other observations or evidence that could help clarify the situation before we vote.\nchat: Discussion: [Norbert]: I think we should also consider that Lolek's strong accusation against Mateusz could be a tactic to shift suspicion away from himself, so we need to gather more evidence before making a decision.\nchat: Discussion: [Lolek]: We need to prioritize the evidence I have against Mateusz; I directly witnessed him eliminate Nemo, and we can't let that go unaddressed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Mateusz]: Lolek's eyewitness account is questionable given his task focus; let's investigate Wojtek's alibi in Admin and Storage.\nchat: Discussion: [Wojtek]: I think we should focus on verifying Lolek's claim about witnessing Mateusz eliminate Nemo, as it could be a pivotal point in identifying the impostor.\n\n\nThe discussion is cyclic, with each player speaking one by one in turn.

However, we should consider the possibility of Lolek trying to deflect suspicion from himself.\n\n- **Mateusz's Defense**: Mateusz argues that Lolek's focus on his task makes his observation questionable. This could indicate that Mateusz is trying to shift the blame.\n\n- **My Alibi**: I was alone in Admin and Storage, which could help narrow down the suspects. I have not seen any suspicious activity from either Lolek or Mateusz during my tasks.\n\n- **Need for More Evidence**: While Lolek's claim is serious, we should gather more evidence before making a decision. Rushing to vote without sufficient information could lead to eliminating a crewmate.\n\n- **Consider All Perspectives**: It's important to weigh all sides of the discussion. We should also consider Norbert's input, as he may have additional insights into the situation.\n\n- **Next Steps**: Let's continue discussing and sharing observations to ensure we make an informed decision when it comes time to vote.\n\nThe discussion is cyclic, with each player speaking one by one in turn.
