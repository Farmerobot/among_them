Report Dave's dead body immediately. This is crucial because:\n   - Dave was eliminated in the previous round\n   - Reporting can trigger a discussion and help identify potential impostors\n   - It provides an opportunity to share information with other players\n\n2. During the emergency meeting, share observations:\n   - Mention you saw Charlie eliminate Dave\n   - Highlight the tasks you've seen other players perform (Charlie, Bob, Alice doing tasks in Cafeteria)\n   - This builds credibility and helps identify potential suspicious behavior\n\n3. After the meeting, move to Admin to start working on the \"Fix wiring in admin\" task, which is one of your current objectives.\n\n4.
