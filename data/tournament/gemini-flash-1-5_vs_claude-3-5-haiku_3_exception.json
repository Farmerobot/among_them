Complete the immediate task of starting the coffee maker in the Cafeteria, since you're already in the right location and have this action available.\n\n2. Move to Weapons to address the wiring task in that location, as it's one of the nearby rooms you can access.\n\n3. If possible during the next round, fix the wiring in Weapons to progress towards completing your objectives.\n\n4. Keep track of other players' movements and be prepared to report any suspicious behavior during discussions.\n\nThe plan prioritizes completing available tasks efficiently while staying strategically aware of the other players in the game. Starting with the coffee maker task in your current location provides an immediate objective completion, and then moving to Weapons allows you to make progress on another pending task.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
