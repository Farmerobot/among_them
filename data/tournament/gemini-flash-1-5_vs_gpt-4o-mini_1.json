this could indicate he has something to hide.\n- Since Erin and Charlie both support sticking to the cafeteria timeline, I think we should continue to emphasize this point and ensure that Bob's narrative aligns with ours.\n- I propose that we each take a moment to recount not just our tasks but also our movements in the cafeteria to build a comprehensive timeline and identify any potential inconsistencies.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I saw Alice, Charlie, Erin, and Dave in the cafeteria seemingly working on tasks, but the speed at which some tasks were completed seems suspicious, so let's consider who had the opportunity to eliminate someone, not just who was seen doing tasks.\n[Charlie]: Bob's comment about task completion speed seems like a tactic to shift suspicion away from himself, especially since I saw Erin working on the same task as him;
