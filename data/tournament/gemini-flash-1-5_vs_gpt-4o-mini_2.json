He claims to have seen me kill Dave, but provides no specifics about my actions or his own position.  This lack of detail is suspicious.\n\n- Let's focus on inconsistencies.  Charlie's account is vague and lacks the concrete details needed to verify his claim.  His insistence despite this vagueness is more concerning than my alleged actions.\n\n-  Alice is questioning Charlie's story, too.  This shows that even other crewmates are finding his account unconvincing. We should trust Alice's judgment.\n\n- Voting for Charlie now prevents further false accusations and protects us from his potential deception.  His unsubstantiated claims are a bigger threat than any risk I pose.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I was in the cafeteria with Dave earlier, and then saw Charlie head towards Medbay shortly after;
