It would be helpful to get a better understanding of what's happening outside of the cafeteria.\n- Since we've got multiple players who have completed tasks in the cafeteria, perhaps we should consider moving to other rooms to tackle other tasks and make progress on our objectives.", "I'd like to reiterate that I was simply completing my task of emptying the trash and had no prior coordination with Alice, and I think Dave's neutral perspective on the situation is a good reminder that we shouldn't jump to conclusions without solid evidence.", "- I think it's crucial to clarify what happened after Alice moved to the Engine Room, and since Erin was the one who saw her move there, Erin's further observations would be valuable in piecing together the events.\n- I agree with Dave that we should ask Erin if she saw anyone else around the Engine Room, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she noticed anything unusual about Alice's behavior when she moved to the Engine Room.\n- Considering Bob's suggestion to focus on who else was near the Engine Room and the tasks performed there, I think it would be helpful to create a mental map of the players' movements and the tasks they completed to identify potential patterns or inconsistencies.\n- Given that I was the one who reported the dead body, I want to assure the group that I had no involvement in Alice's death and that

haven't received an answer from Alice regarding what task she was working on in the Engine Room, and I think it's crucial that we get a clear explanation from her to avoid any further speculation or suspicion.\n- Considering the discussion so far, I think it's essential to establish a clear timeline of events, including who was in the Engine Room and when, to help us identify potential suspects and piece together the events leading up to the discovery of the dead body.\n- I agree with Dave that we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations, and I think it's essential to ask more questions to clarify the situation, such as what tasks are typically performed in the Engine Room and if anyone else was seen in that area.\n- I'd like to ask Bob to elaborate on what he means by \"further investigation into the tasks performed in that area\" and what specific actions he proposes we take to investigate Alice's actions in the Engine Room.\n- I think it's also important to remember that we shouldn't focus solely on Alice's actions, but also consider the behavior and alibis of all players, including those who were in the Cafeteria with me, to ensure we're not missing any potential clues or suspects.", "I'd like to reiterate my previous request for Alice to clarify what task she was working on in the Engine Room, as this information is still outstanding and crucial to moving forward with the investigation and avoiding further speculation.", "- It's concerning that Alice has yet to respond to multiple requests for clarification on what task she was working on in the Engine Room, and I think it's essential that she provides a clear answer to alleviate the growing suspicion.\n- I agree with Dave that Alice's continued silence on this matter is hindering our progress in the investigation, and I urge her to provide a detailed account of her actions in the Engine Room to address everyone's concerns.\n- Considering the lack of response from Alice, I think it's crucial that we consider the possibility that she might be hiding something, and we should be cautious of her actions moving forward.\n- I'd like to ask the group if anyone has any information about the tasks that can be performed in the Engine Room, as this could help us better understand the context of Alice's actions and make a more informed decision about how to proceed.", "I'd like to emphasize that Alice's prolonged silence on the matter of her task in the Engine Room is not only suspicious but also obstructive to our investigation, and I strongly urge her to provide a clear and detailed account of her actions to address the growing concerns and avoid further speculation.", "- I agree with Dave that we should give Alice one last chance to respond, but her silence has been deafening, and it's becoming increasingly likely that she's hiding something.\n- I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Alice's silence is not just suspicious but also a deliberate attempt to hinder our investigation and create confusion among the crew.\n- Given the lack of response from Alice, I think it's essential to discuss potential alternatives and consider other players who might have been involved in the events leading up to the discovery of the dead body.\n- I'd like to ask Erin if she noticed anything unusual about Dave's behavior when she saw him starting the coffee maker in the cafeteria, as this could help us identify potential suspects and piece together the events.\n- Considering the current state of the discussion, I think it's crucial

Did you notice anyone else doing anything unusual?\n- Bob, what made you think Alice and Charlie were working together? Was there something specific you saw that raised your suspicions?\n- I think it's a good idea for us to share our alibis and what we've been doing so far.
