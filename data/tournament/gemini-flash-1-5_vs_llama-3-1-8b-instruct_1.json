A quick round-robin of locations could help us narrow things down.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I saw Dave in Medbay earlier; anyone else see him there?\n[Erin]: I think it's a good idea to keep a close eye on Dave's movements, and I'd like to ask Dave himself if he can tell us what he was doing in Medbay and if he's made any progress on the tasks.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to add that I saw Dave arguing with Alex in the Cafeteria around the time the alarm sounded, and I think it's crucial that we investigate this potential conflict and ask Alex if they witnessed anything unusual, as it could be a crucial piece of evidence in determining what really happened to Dave.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential we press Dave for a detailed explanation of his activities in Medbay and his interactions with Alex in the Cafeteria, as the inconsistencies in his alibi and the reported argument with Alex raise significant concerns about his involvement and potential motives.\n[Alice]: While the argument between Dave and Alex is suspicious,  let's also consider who else had access to Medbay around the time of the death.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I also saw Alice doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when I was in Cafeteria, and I think it's worth investigating if anyone else saw Dave enter or leave Medbay around the time of the death, as it could help clarify his alibi and provide more context for the events leading up to Dave's death.\n[Charlie]: I think we should focus on gathering more information about Dave's alibi and potential motives by questioning him directly about his activities in Medbay and his argument with Alex, and I propose we also ask Alex to provide a detailed account of their interactions with Dave and any other suspicious behavior they may have witnessed.\n[Bob]: I'd like to propose that we ask Dave to clarify his alibi for the time he was in Medbay by providing a detailed timeline of his activities, including any interactions with other crew members, and also ask Alex to provide a statement about their argument in the Cafeteria and if they witnessed Dave entering or leaving Medbay around the time of the death, as this could help us better understand Dave's potential involvement and motives.\n[Alice]: While Dave's whereabouts are certainly suspicious,  let's remember that focusing on one person could distract us from the real killer.\n[Erin]: I think it's essential we continue to investigate Dave's alibi and potential motives, as the inconsistencies in his story and the reported argument with Alex raise significant concerns about his involvement, and I'd like to propose that we ask Dave to provide a detailed timeline of his activities in Medbay, including any interactions with other crew members, to help clarify his alibi and provide more context for the events leading up to Dave's death.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate the importance of gathering more information about Dave's alibi and potential motives by questioning him directly about his activities in Medbay and his argument with Alex, and I propose we also ask Alex to provide a detailed account of their interactions with Dave and any other suspicious behavior they may have witnessed, as this could help us better understand Dave's potential involvement and motives.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add to the discussion by saying that I think it's crucial we also investigate Alex's alibi and potential motives, as they were involved in the argument with Dave in the Cafeteria and may have witnessed Dave entering or leaving Medbay around the time of the death. I'd like to propose that we ask Alex to provide a detailed statement about their interactions with Dave and any other suspicious behavior they may have witnessed, as this could help us better understand Dave's potential involvement and motives.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to suggest that we also ask Dave to provide a detailed timeline of his activities in Medbay, including any interactions with other crew members, to help clarify his alibi and provide more context for the events leading up to Dave's death. This could help us determine if Dave's story is consistent and if he has any potential motives for the crime.\n\nIt's also essential we keep a close eye on Dave's movements and investigate any suspicious behavior, as we don't want to jump to conclusions but also need to gather as much information as possible before making any decisions. I agree with Erin that we should prioritize gathering more information about Dave's alibi and potential motives, and I'd like to propose that we also ask Dave to provide a detailed statement about his argument with Alex in the Cafeteria, including any context or details that may have led to the argument.\n\nLet's not forget that we have limited time left to discuss and vote, so we should prioritize gathering as much information as possible about Dave's activities and potential motives before making any decisions.\n[Alice]: Focusing solely on Dave and Alex is a distraction;  let's investigate everyone's alibi and access to Medbay.\n[Erin]: I think it's crucial we continue to investigate Dave's alibi and potential motives, and to support Alice's suggestion, I'd like to propose that we also ask everyone, including Charlie and Bob, to provide a detailed statement about their interactions with Dave and any other suspicious behavior they may have witnessed, as this could help us better understand Dave's potential involvement and motives, and also ensure that we're not missing any crucial information from other crew members.\n[Charlie]: I think it's essential we also investigate Charlie's alibi and potential motives, as they were in the Cafeteria at the time of the argument between Dave and Alex and may have witnessed Dave entering or leaving Medbay around the time of the death, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a detailed statement about their interactions with Dave and any other suspicious behavior they may have witnessed.\n[Bob]: I'd like to emphasize the importance of Charlie's potential role in the events surrounding Dave's death, as their presence in the Cafeteria at the time of the argument between Dave and Alex raises significant questions about their involvement and potential motives, and I propose we ask Charlie to provide a detailed statement about their interactions with Dave and any other suspicious behavior they may have witnessed, as this could help us better understand the sequence of events and identify potential accomplices or motives.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "To efficiently use our remaining time, let's quickly review everyone's location when the alarm sounded, then focus on who had access to Medbay.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Dave in Medbay earlier;
