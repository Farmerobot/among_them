they haven't said anything about their location during the time of Charlie's death, while the rest of us have clear alibis or at least have explained our movements.\n\n- To summarize what we know: Alice, Bob, and I were together in Weapons doing tasks, Erin claims to have been scanning in Medbay, Charlie was found dead outside Medbay, and Frank is completely unaccounted for.\n\n- Erin's story about being in Medbay doing a scan could potentially be verified since it's a visual task - did anyone else see the scan animation while passing by Medbay?\n\n- Given that Charlie's body was found just outside Medbay where Erin was, we should consider two possibilities: either Erin killed Charlie and self-reported, or Frank did it while Erin was inside doing the scan.\n\n- I think we should vote for Frank this round -

split vote benefiting an impostor.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since I've been consistently transparent about my
