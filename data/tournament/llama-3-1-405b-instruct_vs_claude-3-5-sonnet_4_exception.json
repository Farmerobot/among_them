Complete task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria (Take advantage of your current location to complete both Cafeteria tasks)\n3. Move to Medbay (To continue your diagnostics task that has a time limit of 2 turns)\n\nThis plan is efficient because it:\n- Takes advantage of your current location to complete two tasks without moving\n- Prioritizes moving to Medbay next since you have a time-sensitive task there\n- Makes the most of available actions\n- Doesn't waste time with unnecessary movement\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\n- complete task: Empty the cafeteria trash\n- complete task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\n"], "actions": ["wait in Cafeteria", "move to location Medbay", "move to location Admin", "move to location Weapons", "complete task: Empty the cafeteria trash", "complete task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria"], "response": "4", "action_result": "Task Empty the cafeteria trash completed!", "seen_actions": ["You saw Erin doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria", "You saw Bob doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria", "You saw Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria", "You saw Dave doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria"], "player_in_room": "Players in room with you: [Erin, Bob, Dave]", "observations": [], "chat_messages": []}]}, "adventure_agent": null, "discussion_agent": null, "voting_agent": null, "llm_model_name": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"}], "game_stage": "Action Phase", "playthrough": ["Action: round: 0 (0.003161$). p0 Erin doing task Empty the cafeteria trash [Bob, Alice, Dave, Charlie] saw this action", "Action: round: 0 (0.011303$). p1 Bob doing task Empty the cafeteria trash [Erin, Alice, Dave, Charlie] saw this action", "Action: round: 0 (0.020348$). p2 Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria [Erin, Bob, Dave, Charlie] saw this action", "Action: round: 0 (0.028961$). p3 Dave doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria [Erin, Bob, Charlie] saw this action", "Action: round: 0 (0.03743$). p4 Charlie doing task Empty the cafeteria trash [Erin, Bob, Dave] saw this action"], "save_playthrough": "", "DEBUG": false, "round_number": 1, "player_to_act_next": 0, "round_of_discussion_start": 0}
