However, I'd like to point out that she never actually mentioned my behavior in Medbay, and I'm not sure why she's trying to twist my words. Let's focus on the facts and not get bogged down in semantics.\n- I'd like to propose that we take a step back and re-evaluate the evidence before us.

he's now trying to use the fact that he reported Bob's body as evidence of his innocence, when in fact being the one to report a body you created is a common impostor tactic\n\n- We have multiple pieces of evidence against Dave: his false story about Sarah in cafeteria (which I personally know is false since I was there), Alice seeing him go to Medbay with Bob before Bob's death, and his attempts to fabricate conversations that never happened\n\n- The fact that three of us (myself, Charlie, and Alice) can all corroborate each other's stories and movements, while Dave's statements consistently contradict reality, strongly suggests he is the impostor\n\n- I think we need to vote for Dave - he's demonstrating classic impostor behavior by trying to deflect, create false narratives, and now attempting to reframe his reporting of Bob's body as somehow exonerating him\n\n- Let's not let Dave distract us with his \"bigger picture\" rhetoric -

I was in the cafeteria at the start and saw her doing the wiring task there. I never saw Sarah in the cafeteria either.\n\n- I've been tracking Bob's movements quite a bit - saw him in Admin, Storage (doing trash chute task), Electrical, Lower Engine, and Upper Engine (where he was aligning engine output). His tasks seem legitimate.\n\n- Dave's claim about Sarah in the cafeteria is suspicious since multiple players (myself, Erin, and Charlie) were there and didn't see her. This makes me question Dave's credibility.\n\n- I've been moving through several rooms (Cafeteria, Admin, Storage, Electrical, Lower Engine, Security, Upper Engine, Medbay, back to Cafeteria, and now Weapons) completing tasks and can provide a clear account of my movements.\n\n- Given the inconsistency in Dave's story about Sarah and the fact that three of us can contradict his claim, I think we should be more suspicious of Dave than Sarah.", "I was in the cafeteria early on and can confirm that Dave's story about Sarah doesn't match what I saw - I witnessed Erin doing wiring tasks but never saw Sarah there at all.", "Based on the observations and discussion, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I can provide a clear timeline of events: I saw Dave move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and later I observed both Dave and Bob going to Medbay\n- I've been following Bob's movements throughout the game - he was doing legitimate tasks like emptying trash in Storage and aligning engine output in Upper Engine before his death\n- Dave's story about Sarah in the cafeteria is definitely false - I was there at the start and only saw Erin doing wiring tasks, Charlie and Bob moving to other locations\n- It's very suspicious that Dave reported Bob's body in Medbay, especially since I saw both of them go there just before the report\n- I strongly support voting for Dave - his false story about Sarah combined with being the last person seen with Bob makes him the likely impostor", "I can also add that I personally saw Dave and Bob heading to Medbay right before Bob's body was reported, which makes Dave's attempt to deflect suspicion onto Sarah even more suspicious.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that I directly witnessed Dave and Bob going to Medbay together, which was right before Bob's body was found. This is a crucial piece of evidence.\n\n- Dave's behavior is becoming increasingly suspicious - he first made up a story about Sarah in cafeteria, which I can personally refute since I was there, and now he's fabricating statements about Erin's observations.\n\n- To be clear about the timeline: I was in cafeteria early on with Erin (who I saw doing wiring tasks), and Sarah was definitely not there during that time. This directly contradicts Dave's initial claim.\n\n- Multiple of us (myself, Erin, and Charlie) have all independently confirmed that Dave's story about Sarah doesn't match reality.

I've been tracking everyone's movements carefully, and Dave's story about Sarah in the cafeteria directly contradicts what multiple of us witnessed firsthand.\n[Alice]: I can also add that I personally saw Dave and Bob heading to Medbay right before Bob's body was reported, which makes Dave's attempt to deflect suspicion onto Sarah even more suspicious.\n[Dave]: I'd like to clarify my previous message about Erin's observation of my behavior in Medbay, as I believe she may have misinterpreted my actions, and I'd like to provide further context to clear up any confusion and refocus our attention on the task at hand.\n[Erin]: The fact that Dave is now trying to twist my words about Medbay when I never actually mentioned his behavior there - I only referenced Alice's observation - further proves he's desperately trying to cover his tracks.\n[Charlie]: I find it telling that Dave is now fabricating statements about Medbay that Erin never made, which combined with his false story about Sarah and his presence near Bob's body, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\n[Alice]: Given that I personally saw Dave and Bob go to Medbay together right before Bob's body was found, and Dave is now making up conversations that never happened, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote him out.\n[Dave]: I'm glad we're making progress in discussing the inconsistencies in my story, and I appreciate Erin and others bringing this to light, but I think we're getting off track by focusing on my alibi and not considering the bigger picture, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and re-evaluate the evidence before us, specifically the fact that multiple people have confirmed that I reported Bob's body, and I'm the one who actually found it in Medbay, which seems to be a significant action that deserves attention.\n[Erin]: The fact that Dave is now trying to use his reporting of Bob's body as evidence of innocence - when he was seen going to Medbay with Bob right before the murder - is exactly the kind of deceptive tactic we'd expect from an impostor.\n[Charlie]: The fact that Dave is now desperately clinging to his role in reporting Bob's body -

This is a crucial piece of evidence.\n\n- Dave's behavior is becoming increasingly suspicious - he first made up a story about Sarah in cafeteria, which I can personally refute since I was there, and now he's fabricating statements about Erin's observations.\n\n- To be clear about the timeline: I was in cafeteria early on with Erin (who I saw doing wiring tasks), and Sarah was definitely not there during that time.

Discussion: [Dave]: I'm glad we're making progress in Medbay, Bob, but I'm a bit concerned that Sarah seemed a bit off when I passed by the cafeteria earlier, maybe we should discuss her behavior before we proceed with the task.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's story doesn't add up since I was in the cafeteria early on and never saw Sarah there, plus I can confirm Charlie and Alice were doing legitimate tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm Erin's observations since I've been watching her complete multiple tasks, and I never saw Sarah in the cafeteria when Dave claims to have seen her.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the cafeteria early on and can confirm that Dave's story about Sarah doesn't match what I saw - I witnessed Erin doing wiring tasks but never saw Sarah there at all.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we're getting a bit too focused on verifying alibis and should instead discuss the inconsistencies in Dave's story, as even if Erin and Charlie have been doing tasks, Dave's claims about Sarah's behavior in the cafeteria don't seem to match up with what the rest of us have seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since multiple people have now confirmed my observation about Dave's false story regarding Sarah in the cafeteria, and considering he reported Bob's body after being near Medbay, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Dave as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin's conclusion - I've been tracking everyone's movements carefully, and Dave's story about Sarah in the cafeteria directly contradicts what multiple of us witnessed firsthand.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can also add that I personally saw Dave and Bob heading to Medbay right before Bob's body was reported, which makes Dave's attempt to deflect suspicion onto Sarah even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to clarify my previous message about Erin's observation of my behavior in Medbay, as I believe she may have misinterpreted my actions, and I'd like to provide further context to clear up any confusion and refocus our attention on the task at hand.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The fact that Dave is now trying to twist my words about Medbay when I never actually mentioned his behavior there - I only referenced Alice's observation - further proves he's desperately trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it telling that Dave is now fabricating statements about Medbay that Erin never made, which combined with his false story about Sarah and his presence near Bob's body, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that I personally saw Dave and Bob go to Medbay together right before Bob's body was found, and Dave is now making up conversations that never happened, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'm glad we're making progress in discussing the inconsistencies in my story, and I appreciate Erin and others bringing this to light, but I think we're getting off track by focusing on my alibi and not considering the bigger picture, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and re-evaluate the evidence before us, specifically the fact that multiple people have confirmed that I reported Bob's body, and I'm the one who actually found it in Medbay, which seems to be a significant action that deserves attention.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The fact that Dave is now trying to use his reporting of Bob's body as evidence of innocence - when he was seen going to Medbay with Bob right before the murder - is exactly the kind of deceptive tactic we'd expect from an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Dave is now desperately clinging to his role in reporting Bob's body - when Alice saw him enter Medbay with Bob right before the murder - only

reasonable doubt.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_WEAPONS\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I'm glad we're making progress in Medbay, Bob, but I'm a bit concerned that Sarah seemed a bit off when I passed by the cafeteria earlier, maybe we should discuss her behavior before we proceed with the task.\n[Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's story doesn't add up since I was in the cafeteria early on and never saw Sarah there, plus I can confirm Charlie and Alice were doing legitimate tasks.\n[Charlie]: I can confirm Erin's observations since I've been watching her complete multiple tasks, and I never saw Sarah in the cafeteria when Dave claims to have seen her.\n[Alice]: I was in the cafeteria early on and can confirm that Dave's story about Sarah doesn't match what I saw - I witnessed Erin doing wiring tasks but never saw Sarah there at all.\n[Dave]: I think we're getting a bit too focused on verifying alibis and should instead discuss the inconsistencies in Dave's story, as even if Erin and Charlie have been doing tasks, Dave's claims about Sarah's behavior in the cafeteria don't seem to match up with what the rest of us have seen.\n[Erin]: Since multiple people have now confirmed my observation about Dave's false story regarding Sarah in the cafeteria, and considering he reported Bob's body after being near Medbay, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Dave as the impostor.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Erin's conclusion - I've been tracking everyone's movements carefully, and Dave's story about Sarah in the cafeteria directly contradicts what multiple of us witnessed firsthand.\n[Alice]: I can also add that I personally saw Dave and Bob heading to Medbay right before Bob's body was reported, which makes Dave's attempt to deflect suspicion onto Sarah even more suspicious.\n[Dave]: I'd like to clarify my previous message about Erin's observation of my behavior in Medbay, as I believe she may have misinterpreted my actions, and I'd like to provide further context to clear up any confusion and refocus our attention on the task at hand.\n[Erin]: The fact that Dave is now trying to twist my words about Medbay when I never actually mentioned his behavior there - I only referenced Alice's observation - further proves he's desperately trying to cover his tracks.\n[Charlie]: I find it telling that Dave is now fabricating statements about Medbay that Erin never made, which combined with his false story about Sarah and his presence near Bob's body, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\n[Alice]: Given that I personally saw Dave and Bob go to Medbay together right before Bob's body was found, and Dave is now making up conversations that never happened, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote him out.\n[Dave]: I'm glad we're making progress in discussing the inconsistencies in my story, and I appreciate Erin and others bringing this to light, but I think we're getting off track by focusing on my alibi and not considering the bigger picture, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and re-evaluate the evidence before us, specifically the fact that multiple people have confirmed that I reported Bob's body, and I'm the one who actually found it in Medbay, which seems to be a significant action that deserves attention.\n[Erin]: The fact that Dave is now trying to use his reporting of Bob's body as evidence of innocence - when he was seen going to Medbay with Bob right before the murder - is exactly the kind of deceptive tactic we'd expect from an impostor.\n[Charlie]: The fact that Dave is now desperately clinging to his role in reporting Bob's body - when Alice saw him enter Medbay with Bob right before the murder - only further confirms my suspicion that he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\n[Alice]: Since I directly witnessed Dave and Bob entering Medbay together right before Bob's death, and Dave is now desperately trying to use reporting the body as proof of innocence, I think his guilt is beyond any reasonable doubt.\n[Dave]: I'd like to point out that I'm not trying to deflect suspicion onto Sarah, but rather I'm trying to understand her behavior in the cafeteria, as I believe this might be relevant to the task at hand, and I'd like to ask her to clarify her previous statement about my behavior in Medbay, as I believe she may have misinterpreted my actions.\n[Erin]: Given that Dave is now trying to engage with Sarah who isn't even part of our current discussion, while continuing to reference his debunked cafeteria story, I think his increasingly desperate attempts at misdirection only further confirm he's the impostor.\n[Charlie]: The fact that Dave is now trying to engage with Sarah - who isn't even present in this discussion - while still pushing his thoroughly debunked cafeteria story shows just how desperate he's becoming to avoid being caught as the impostor.\n", "\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- Dave's behavior has become increasingly erratic and suspicious - he's now trying to talk to Sarah who isn't even part of our discussion\n- I want to emphasize again that I personally witnessed Dave and Bob going to Medbay together right before Bob's death - this is direct evidence I observed firsthand\n- Dave's initial false story about Sarah in the cafeteria, which I could verify was untrue since I was there early on, shows he was trying to create a false narrative from the start\n- The fact that Dave is trying to use reporting Bob's body as proof of innocence, when he was the last person seen with Bob, is extremely suspicious\n- I think we have overwhelming evidence against Dave at this point: his false stories, his presence with Bob before the murder, and his increasingly desperate attempts to deflect and confuse the discussion\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I'm glad we're making progress in Medbay, Bob, but I'm a bit concerned that Sarah seemed a bit off when I passed by the cafeteria
