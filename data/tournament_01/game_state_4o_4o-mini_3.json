Ensure no other players are nearby to witness the elimination.\n\n3. **Move to Location Upper Engine**: After taking action or if no opportunity arises in Medbay, move to the Upper Engine.

Medbay is often a less crowded area, which could provide an opportunity to eliminate a crewmate without being seen.\n\n2. **Wait in Medbay**: Observe if any crewmates enter the area. If a crewmate is alone, consider eliminating them. If not, continue to blend in and wait for the right moment.\n\n3. **Pretend Doing Task: Fix Wiring in Cafeteria**: After spending some time in Medbay, return to the Cafeteria and pretend to fix wiring. This will help you blend in with the crewmates and avoid suspicion.\n\n4. **Call Emergency Meeting (if necessary)**: If you need to shift suspicion or create confusion, consider calling an emergency meeting to discuss any findings or suspicions. Use this opportunity to steer the conversation away from yourself and towards other players.\n\nThis plan allows you to maintain your cover while positioning yourself strategically to eliminate crewmates.

See if any crewmates enter the area alone. This will help you decide whether to take action or remain inconspicuous.\n\n2. **Eliminate Lolek (if alone)**: If Lolek is alone in Medbay with you, seize the opportunity to eliminate him. Ensure no other players are nearby to witness the elimination.\n\n3. **Move to Location Upper Engine**: After taking action or if no opportunity arises in Medbay, move to the Upper Engine. This will help you change locations and potentially find other isolated crewmates.\n\n4. **Pretend Doing Task: Fix Wiring in Upper Engine**: Once in the Upper Engine, pretend to fix wiring.

This will help reduce the number of crewmates and bring you closer to your objective.\n\n2. **Move to Location Upper Engine**: After eliminating Lolek, quickly move to the Upper Engine to change your location and avoid suspicion.

Medbay is often a less crowded area, which could provide an opportunity to eliminate a crewmate without being seen.\n\n2. **Wait in Medbay**: Observe if any crewmates enter the area. If a crewmate is alone, consider eliminating them. If not, continue to blend in and wait for the right moment.\n\n3. **Pretend Doing Task: Fix Wiring in Cafeteria**: After spending some time in Medbay, return to the Cafeteria and pretend to fix wiring. This will help you blend in with the crewmates and avoid suspicion.\n\n4. **Call Emergency Meeting (if necessary)**: If you need to shift suspicion or create confusion, consider calling an emergency meeting to discuss any findings or suspicions. Use this opportunity to steer the conversation away from yourself and towards other players.\n\nThis plan allows you to maintain your cover while positioning yourself strategically to eliminate crewmates.

See if any crewmates enter the area alone. This will help you decide whether to take action or remain inconspicuous.\n\n2. **Eliminate Lolek (if alone)**: If Lolek is alone in Medbay with you, seize the opportunity to eliminate him. Ensure no other players are nearby to witness the elimination.\n\n3. **Move to Location Upper Engine**: After taking action or if no opportunity arises in Medbay, move to the Upper Engine. This will help you change locations and potentially find other isolated crewmates.\n\n4. **Pretend Doing Task: Fix Wiring in Upper Engine**: Once in the Upper Engine, pretend to fix wiring. This will help you blend in and reduce suspicion among other players.\n\nThis plan focuses on taking advantage of isolation opportunities while maintaining your cover as a crewmate.

This will help reduce the number of crewmates and bring you closer to your objective.\n\n2. **Move to Location Upper Engine**: After eliminating Lolek, quickly move to the Upper Engine to change your location and avoid suspicion. This will also give you a chance to find other isolated crewmates.\n\n3. **Pretend Doing Task: Fix Wiring in Upper Engine**: Once in the Upper Engine, pretend to fix wiring.
