Your role is either a crewmate or an impostor\n- Impostors can eliminate crewmates, and both crewmates and impostors can report dead bodies\n- Impostors win when there is only one crewmate left\n- Crewmates complete the tasks and impostors can pretend doing tasks\n- Crewmates and impostors can call emergency meetings to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game\n- After each elimination, players must discuss and vote on who to eject from the game\n- The game continues until tasks are completed or impostors eliminate enough crewmates to win\n\nRole of Crewmates:\n- Complete tasks to win the game\n- Report dead bodies and discuss to identify impostors\n- Vote to eject impostors from the game\n\nRole of Impostors:\n- Eliminate crewmates to win the game (until there is only on crewmate left)\n- Blend in with crewmates to avoid being identified\n- Vote to eject crewmates from the game\n\nYou are Lolek in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Norbert]: I agree, we should definitely keep an eye on Lolek and Mateusz since they were both seen moving towards Electrical; let's monitor their actions closely.\n[Mateusz]: [Mateusz]: I understand the concern, but I was in Admin trying to track movements and ensure tasks were being completed, so let's focus on verifying task completions to clear any suspicions.\n[Lolek]: I agree, we need to establish a clear timeline of everyone's movements before Wojtek's death to identify any suspicious behavior, especially focusing on Norbert's quick accusations and verifying Mateusz's alibi in Admin.\n[Norbert]: I appreciate the need for a timeline, Lolek, but we should also focus on verifying Mateusz's alibi in Admin since he was near the scene of the crime.\n[Mateusz]: Let's focus on verifying task completions and keep an eye on Norbert's movements, as his quick accusations seem suspicious.\n[Lolek]: I agree, verifying task completions is essential, and we should also keep a close watch on Norbert's movements since his quick accusations could be a deflection tactic.\n[Norbert]: I think we should prioritize verifying Mateusz's alibi in Admin and gather more information about everyone's tasks to ensure we make an informed decision.\n[Mateusz]: Let's focus on verifying task completions and keep an eye on Norbert's movements, as his quick accusations seem suspicious.\n[Lolek]: I think we should all share our task completions and movements to clarify the timeline, especially focusing on verifying Mateusz's alibi and keeping an eye on Norbert's actions.\n[Norbert]: I think we should all share our task completions and movements to clarify the timeline, especially focusing on verifying Mateusz's alibi in Admin.\n[Mateusz]: Let's focus on verifying task completions and keep an eye on Norbert's movements, as his quick accusations seem suspicious.\n\nPrevious Discussion Points:\n### Discussion Points for Lolek\n\n1. **Timeline Clarification**: I propose we all share our task completions and movements leading up to Wojtek's death to establish a clear timeline. This will help us identify any suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Focus on Alibis**: We should prioritize verifying Mateusz's alibi in Admin, as he claims to have been tracking movements there. This could either clear him or raise further suspicions.\n\n3. **Norbert's Accusations**: Norbert's quick accusations towards both Mateusz and me seem suspicious. We should keep an eye on his movements and actions as well.\n\n4. **Task Verification**: Let's ensure we verify everyone's task completions to gather more information. This will help us make an informed decision before the vote.\n\n5. **Stay Vigilant**: As we discuss, we need to remain vigilant about any deflection tactics being used by players, especially those who are quick to accuse others without substantial evidence. \n\n### Summary of Observations\n- Wojtek is dead, and Norbert reported the body.\n- Norbert is focusing on accusing both me and Mateusz.\n- Mateusz claims to have been in Admin, which needs verification.\n- We need to establish a timeline of movements to identify the impostor.\n\nThe discussion is cyclic, with each player speaking one by one in turn.
