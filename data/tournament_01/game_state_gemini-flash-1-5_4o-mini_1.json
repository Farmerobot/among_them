This establishes a believable presence.\n\n2. **Move to Medbay:** Medbay is a high-traffic area where crewmates often congregate. This increases the chance of a successful elimination opportunity.\n\n3. **Eliminate a crewmate (if opportunity arises):**  In Medbay, look for an isolated crewmate. If an opportunity presents itself to eliminate a crewmate without being seen, do so.\n\n4. **Return to Cafeteria (if no elimination):** If no opportunity arises in Medbay, return to the Cafeteria to continue blending in and wait for a better chance.

This was a necessary action to avoid suspicion.\n\n* **Task Focus:** I agree with the focus on task completion.  This deflects attention from my actions and allows me to blend in.  (This reinforces my previous message.)\n\n* **Vigilance:** I appreciate the vigilance towards me.  This is expected, and I will continue to act normally to avoid suspicion.\n\n* **Strategic Ambiguity:**  I subtly suggested Wojtek and Nemo double-check each other's work. This plants a seed of doubt between them, potentially diverting their attention from me.\n\n* **Next Steps:** I will continue to blend in, complete (fake) tasks, and look for opportunities to eliminate another crewmate.

This helps maintain a low profile and deflect suspicion.\n\n* **Maintain plausible deniability:**  My last known location was Medbay, where I reported Norbert's body.  I was completing tasks there, and I haven't seen anyone else since.  (This is a lie, but it's believable given the circumstances.)\n\n* **Shift suspicion:**  The focus is rightly on me. To deflect this, I suggest we all share our last known locations to clarify everyone's movements. This creates a sense of transparency while subtly shifting the focus away from my actions.\n\n* **Observe and adapt:** I will continue to observe the crewmates' behavior and adjust my strategy accordingly.  The next few rounds will be crucial.\n\nThe discussion is cyclic, with each player speaking one by one in turn.
