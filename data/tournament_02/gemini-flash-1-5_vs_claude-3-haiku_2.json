While I haven't seen Erin myself, it's good to have that additional data point. Since we're still early in the game, I believe our priority should be on completing tasks to win. I'm happy to continue working on the wiring in Admin if that's helpful. Has anyone else noticed any suspicious behavior or been able to confirm Bob's report about Erin? Sharing information like that can help us identify any potential impostors.]\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Weapons for a while and saw Erin doing tasks there, so I can corroborate that she was in that area. Bob's report about seeing Erin heading to Upper Engine is interesting. If anyone else has spotted Erin in other locations, that could help us piece together her movements. I think our focus should be on continuing to complete our tasks efficiently. The more tasks we can get done, the closer we'll be to winning as Crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin's presence in multiple locations in a short timeframe, coupled with my sighting near Upper Engine, warrants further investigation into her movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I think it's important that we continue to investigate Erin's movements and actions. Bob's report about seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration that she saw Erin in Weapons, raises some questions that we should look into further. At the same time, I agree with Alice that our priority should be on efficiently completing our tasks to work towards the Crewmate victory condition. I'm happy to continue focusing on my tasks in Admin, but I'm also willing to assist with any investigation efforts if that would be helpful to the group. By working together and sharing our observations, I believe we can make progress towards identifying any potential impostors while also making headway on our tasks.]\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: [As Alice the Crewmate, I agree that Erin's movements are concerning and warrant further investigation. Bob's report of seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration of seeing her in Weapons, suggests she may have been in multiple locations in a short timeframe. However, I think we need to be careful about drawing any firm conclusions yet. It's important that we continue to gather more information and evidence before accusing anyone. My priority is on efficiently completing our tasks, as that is the best way for us as Crewmates to achieve victory. I'm happy to continue working on my tasks in Weapons, but I'm also willing to assist with any investigation efforts if the group thinks that would be helpful. Perhaps we could all take a moment to share any other observations or information we have about Erin's movements or actions, so we can piece together a more complete picture.

Bob raises a valid point that focusing solely on task completion could allow an impostor to go undetected. I think we need to strike a balance - maintaining our focus on efficiently completing our objectives, but also thoroughly investigating any suspicious behavior or conflicting reports about Erin's whereabouts. By gathering more information and evidence, we can work towards identifying any potential impostors without losing sight of our ultimate goal of winning as Crewmates.

While I haven't seen Erin myself, it's good to have that additional data point. Since we're still early in the game, I believe our priority should be on completing tasks to win. I'm happy to continue working on the wiring in Admin if that's helpful. Has anyone else noticed any suspicious behavior or been able to confirm Bob's report about Erin? Sharing information like that can help us identify any potential impostors.]\n[Alice]: I was in Weapons for a while and saw Erin doing tasks there, so I can corroborate that she was in that area. Bob's report about seeing Erin heading to Upper Engine is interesting. If anyone else has spotted Erin in other locations, that could help us piece together her movements. I think our focus should be on continuing to complete our tasks efficiently. The more tasks we can get done, the closer we'll be to winning as Crewmates.\n[Bob]: Erin's presence in multiple locations in a short timeframe, coupled with my sighting near Upper Engine, warrants further investigation into her movements.\n[Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I think it's important that we continue to investigate Erin's movements and actions. Bob's report about seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration that she saw Erin in Weapons, raises some questions that we should look into further. At the same time, I agree with Alice that our priority should be on efficiently completing our tasks to work towards the Crewmate victory condition. I'm happy to continue focusing on my tasks in Admin, but I'm also willing to assist with any investigation efforts if that would be helpful to the group. By working together and sharing our observations, I believe we can make progress towards identifying any potential impostors while also making headway on our tasks.]\n[Alice]: [As Alice the Crewmate, I agree that Erin's movements are concerning and warrant further investigation. Bob's report of seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration of seeing her in Weapons, suggests she may have been in multiple locations in a short timeframe. However, I think we need to be careful about drawing any firm conclusions yet. It's important that we continue to gather more information and evidence before accusing anyone. My priority is on efficiently completing our tasks, as that is the best way for us as Crewmates to achieve victory. I'm happy to continue working on my tasks in Weapons, but I'm also willing to assist with any investigation efforts if the group thinks that would be helpful.

Ultimately, I believe we need to be thorough and objective in our approach, rather than making hasty accusations without sufficient evidence.]\n[Bob]: Erin's movements seem suspicious, and while task completion is vital, focusing solely on that might let an impostor slip through; let's prioritize corroborating observations to identify inconsistencies before more crewmates are eliminated.\n[Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I agree that we should prioritize corroborating observations about Erin's movements to identify any potential inconsistencies, while also continuing to make progress on our tasks. Bob raises a valid point that focusing solely on task completion could allow an impostor to go undetected.

Is this normal behavior for a crewmate?\n\n-  Let's be clear:  I'm not accusing Erin, but her movements *do* raise questions.  We need to consider the possibility of an impostor cleverly moving between locations to avoid suspicion.  Focusing solely on tasks risks overlooking a critical threat.\n\n-  I propose we each share our complete movement logs for the past few rounds.  A detailed comparison might reveal further inconsistencies in Erin's, or anyone else's, timeline.  Transparency is key to finding the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I was near Electrical a few rounds ago and saw Erin heading towards Upper Engine; has anyone else corroborated that?\n[Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I think Bob's report about seeing Erin heading towards Upper Engine is an important piece of information that we should follow up on. While I haven't seen Erin myself, it's good to have that additional data point. Since we're still early in the game, I believe our priority should be on completing tasks to win. I'm happy to continue working on the wiring in Admin if that's helpful. Has anyone else noticed any suspicious behavior or been able to confirm Bob's report about Erin? Sharing information like that can help us identify any potential impostors.]\n[Alice]: I was in Weapons for a while and saw Erin doing tasks there, so I can corroborate that she was in that area. Bob's report about seeing Erin heading to Upper Engine is interesting. If anyone else has spotted Erin in other locations, that could help us piece together her movements. I think our focus should be on continuing to complete our tasks efficiently. The more tasks we can get done, the closer we'll be to winning as Crewmates.\n[Bob]: Erin's presence in multiple locations in a short timeframe, coupled with my sighting near Upper Engine, warrants further investigation into her movements.\n[Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I think it's important that we continue to investigate Erin's movements and actions. Bob's report about seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration that she saw Erin in Weapons, raises some questions that we should look into further. At the same time, I agree with Alice that our priority should be on efficiently completing our tasks to work towards the Crewmate victory condition. I'm happy to continue focusing on my tasks in Admin, but I'm also willing to assist with any investigation efforts if that would be helpful to the group.

Bob's report of seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration of seeing her in Weapons, suggests she may have been in multiple locations in a short timeframe.

Ultimately, I believe we need to be thorough and objective in our approach, rather than making hasty accusations without sufficient evidence.]\n[Bob]: Erin's movements seem suspicious, and while task completion is vital, focusing solely on that might let an impostor slip through; let's prioritize corroborating observations to identify inconsistencies before more crewmates are eliminated.\n[Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I agree that we should prioritize corroborating observations about Erin's movements to identify any potential inconsistencies, while also continuing to make progress on our tasks.

Bob's report about seeing Erin heading to Upper Engine is interesting. If anyone else has spotted Erin in other locations, that could help us piece together her movements. I think our focus should be on continuing to complete our tasks efficiently. The more tasks we can get done, the closer we'll be to winning as Crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin's presence in multiple locations in a short timeframe, coupled with my sighting near Upper Engine, warrants further investigation into her movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I think it's important that we continue to investigate Erin's movements and actions. Bob's report about seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration that she saw Erin in Weapons, raises some questions that we should look into further. At the same time, I agree with Alice that our priority should be on efficiently completing our tasks to work towards the Crewmate victory condition. I'm happy to continue focusing on my tasks in Admin, but I'm also willing to assist with any investigation efforts if that would be helpful to the group.

Bob's report of seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration of seeing her in Weapons, suggests she may have been in multiple locations in a short timeframe. However, I think we need to be careful about drawing any firm conclusions yet. It's important that we continue to gather more information and evidence before accusing anyone. My priority is on efficiently completing our tasks, as that is the best way for us as Crewmates to achieve victory. I'm happy to continue working on my tasks in Weapons, but I'm also willing to assist with any investigation efforts if the group thinks that would be helpful.

Ultimately, I believe we need to be thorough and objective in our approach, rather than making hasty accusations without sufficient evidence.]\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin's movements seem suspicious, and while task completion is vital, focusing solely on that might let an impostor slip through; let's prioritize corroborating observations to identify inconsistencies before more crewmates are eliminated.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I agree that we should prioritize corroborating observations about Erin's movements to identify any potential inconsistencies, while also continuing to make progress on our tasks. Bob raises a valid point that focusing solely on task completion could allow an impostor to go undetected. I think we need to strike a balance - maintaining our focus on efficiently completing our objectives, but also thoroughly investigating any suspicious behavior or conflicting reports about Erin's whereabouts. By gathering more information and evidence, we can work towards identifying any potential impostors without losing sight of our ultimate goal of winning as Crewmates.

While I haven't seen Erin myself, it's good to have that additional data point. Since we're still early in the game, I believe our priority should be on completing tasks to win. I'm happy to continue working on the wiring in Admin if that's helpful. Has anyone else noticed any suspicious behavior or been able to confirm Bob's report about Erin? Sharing information like that can help us identify any potential impostors.]\n[Alice]: I was in Weapons for a while and saw Erin doing tasks there, so I can corroborate that she was in that area. Bob's report about seeing Erin heading to Upper Engine is interesting. If anyone else has spotted Erin in other locations, that could help us piece together her movements. I think our focus should be on continuing to complete our tasks efficiently. The more tasks we can get done, the closer we'll be to winning as Crewmates.\n[Bob]: Erin's presence in multiple locations in a short timeframe, coupled with my sighting near Upper Engine, warrants further investigation into her movements.\n[Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I think it's important that we continue to investigate Erin's movements and actions. Bob's report about seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration that she saw Erin in Weapons, raises some questions that we should look into further. At the same time, I agree with Alice that our priority should be on efficiently completing our tasks to work towards the Crewmate victory condition. I'm happy to continue focusing on my tasks in Admin, but I'm also willing to assist with any investigation efforts if that would be helpful to the group. By working together and sharing our observations, I believe we can make progress towards identifying any potential impostors while also making headway on our tasks.]\n[Alice]: [As Alice the Crewmate, I agree that Erin's movements are concerning and warrant further investigation. Bob's report of seeing her heading towards Upper Engine, combined with Alice's corroboration of seeing her in Weapons, suggests she may have been in multiple locations in a short timeframe. However, I think we need to be careful about drawing any firm conclusions yet. It's important that we continue to gather more information and evidence before accusing anyone. My priority is on efficiently completing our tasks, as that is the best way for us as Crewmates to achieve victory. I'm happy to continue working on my tasks in Weapons, but I'm also willing to assist with any investigation efforts if the group thinks that would be helpful. Perhaps we could all take a moment to share any other observations or information we have about Erin's movements or actions, so we can piece together a more complete picture. Ultimately, I believe we need to be thorough and objective in our approach, rather than making hasty accusations without sufficient evidence.]\n[Bob]: Erin's movements seem suspicious, and while task completion is vital, focusing solely on that might let an impostor slip through; let's prioritize corroborating observations to identify inconsistencies before more crewmates are eliminated.\n[Charlie]: [As Charlie the Crewmate, I agree that we should prioritize corroborating observations about Erin's movements to identify any potential inconsistencies, while also continuing to make progress on our tasks. Bob raises a valid point that focusing solely on task completion could allow an impostor to go undetected. I think we need to strike a balance - maintaining our focus on efficiently completing our objectives, but also thoroughly investigating any suspicious behavior or conflicting reports about Erin's whereabouts.

No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Reactor\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Security\n- move to location Lower Engine\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nReactor\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\nYou are alone in the room\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in Reactor\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Security\n- move to location Lower Engine\n\nPlanned Steps:\nGiven the current game state and objectives, here is a 3-step plan for Erin the Crewmate:\n\n1. Move to Upper Engine.\n2. Complete the task \"Align engine output in upper engine\".\n3. Wait in Upper Engine.\n\nExplanation:\n- The first step is to move to the Upper Engine room, as this is one of the available actions and would allow you to work on the \"Align engine output in upper engine\" task.\n- Completing this task is crucial, as it is one of the only two remaining tasks to be done.\n- After finishing the task, waiting in the Upper Engine room is the best option, as you cannot move to any other location at the moment, and waiting allows you to conserve resources.\n\nThis plan focuses on progressing the game by completing the outstanding task. Since you currently cannot move to the Security room to check the headings in navigation, the best course of action is to address the task in Upper Engine first. By waiting in the Upper Engine room after completing the task, you can be ready to respond to any new developments in the next round.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Reactor\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Security\n- move to location Lower
