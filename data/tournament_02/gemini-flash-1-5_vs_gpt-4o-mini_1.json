This is strong evidence.\n- Dave's continued insistence on his innocence despite the lack of supporting evidence is suspicious.  He's creating more doubt than he's clearing up.\n-  The timing of Dave's contradictory statements is also important. He's only contradicting after we've presented a united front against him.\n-  Voting out Dave is the safest option for the crew given the overwhelming evidence against him.  Let's not let his attempts at manipulation sway our decision.\n-  Remember, the goal is to complete tasks and eliminate imposters.  Sticking together and voting strategically is key to winning.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I saw Dave and Alice head to Medbay together, and I've been busy \"emptying the trash\" in the cafeteria \u2013 anyone else corroborate either of those observations?\n[Dave]: Bob's claim about seeing me and Alice heading to Medbay is misleading because I was actually in the Cafeteria the entire time, and I only saw Erin and Charlie there, which raises questions about Bob's whereabouts during Erin's elimination.\n[Charlie]: It's concerning that both Bob and Dave are pointing fingers at each other;

[Alice]: I can confirm that I was indeed in the Cafeteria when Erin was eliminated, and I saw Bob doing the trash task, which supports his alibi, but we need to focus on Dave's contradictory claims

appreciate your input, I still find it odd that Bob is quick to shift the discussion towards Alice instead of addressing the inconsistencies in his own story, especially since I was in the Cafeteria

statements about his whereabouts during Erin's elimination are a significant liability, and I believe we should seriously consider voting him out to protect the crew.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Charlie and Bob; Dave's conflicting statements about his location during Erin's elimination are too concerning to ignore, and voting him out seems like the best course of action to ensure the crew's safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave's shifting story and lack of corroboration, contrasted with the consistent accounts from Charlie and Alice supporting my alibi, clearly points to him as the biggest threat.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand the pressure to make a decision, but I urge everyone to take a step back and consider that Bob's eagerness to shift blame and the lack of solid evidence against me might indicate he's trying to deflect attention from his own inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's evident that the overwhelming support for Bob's alibi from both Alice and myself, coupled with Dave's inconsistent statements, leaves us with no choice but to prioritize the safety of the crew by voting him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the strong corroboration of Bob's and Charlie's alibis by my own observations, it's clear that Dave's conflicting statements pose a significant risk to the crew, and I believe we should proceed with voting him out to ensure our safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Three of us (Alice, Charlie, and myself) corroborate my story, while

[Bob]: I saw Dave and Alice head to Medbay together, and I've been busy \"emptying the trash\" in the cafeteria \u2013 anyone else corroborate either of those observations?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's claim about seeing me and Alice heading to Medbay is misleading because I was actually in the Cafeteria the entire time, and I only saw Erin and Charlie there, which raises questions about Bob's whereabouts during Erin's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's concerning that both Bob and Dave are pointing fingers at each other; I can confirm Bob was with me in the cafeteria when Erin was eliminated, which raises doubts about Dave's claim of being there the entire time \u2013 we really need to clarify Alice's actions to see if she can shed light on this situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that I was indeed in the Cafeteria when Erin was eliminated, and I saw Bob doing the trash task, which supports his alibi, but we need to focus on Dave's contradictory claims about his location to clear up this confusion.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given the conflicting accounts regarding Dave's location and my own confirmed alibi, let's prioritize verifying Alice's whereabouts to determine if she can corroborate either Dave's or my statement.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, while I appreciate your input, I still find it odd that Bob is quick to shift the discussion towards Alice instead of addressing the inconsistencies in his own story, especially since I was in the Cafeteria the whole time and only saw you and Erin there.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's clear that Dave's insistence on being in the cafeteria conflicts with the timeline of Erin's elimination, so I propose we all share our exact locations during that time to identify any inconsistencies in our stories and focus on the evidence at hand.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria the whole time and can confirm I saw both Bob and Charlie there, which supports Bob's alibi and highlights the inconsistencies in Dave's statements that we need to address.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave's contradictory statements about his location during Erin's elimination, unsupported by Charlie and Alice, make him a prime suspect, so let's vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's quick shift to focus on Alice instead of addressing the inconsistencies in his alibi raises red flags, and I urge everyone to reconsider the evidence before making a hasty decision.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given the strong corroboration of Bob's and my alibi by Alice, it's becoming increasingly clear that Dave's conflicting statements about his whereabouts during Erin's elimination are a significant liability, and I believe we should seriously consider voting him out to protect the crew.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Charlie and Bob; Dave's conflicting statements about his location during Erin's elimination are too concerning to ignore, and voting him out seems like the best course of action to ensure the crew's safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave's shifting story and lack of corroboration, contrasted with the consistent accounts from Charlie and Alice supporting my alibi, clearly points to him as the biggest threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand the pressure to make a decision, but I urge everyone to take a step back and consider that Bob's eagerness to shift blame and the lack of solid evidence against me might indicate he's trying to deflect attention from his own inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's evident that the overwhelming support for Bob's alibi from both Alice and myself, coupled with Dave's inconsistent statements, leaves us with no choice but to prioritize the safety of the crew by voting him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the strong corroboration of Bob's and Charlie's alibis by my own observations, it's clear that Dave's conflicting statements pose a significant risk to the crew, and I believe we should proceed with voting him out to ensure our safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Three of us (Alice, Charlie, and myself) corroborate my story, while Dave's account is contradicted by everyone else\u2014let's vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I recognize that the pressure is mounting, but I implore everyone to reconsider the evidence and remember that voting based on conflicting statements without solid proof could lead us to eliminate an innocent crewmate, especially when Bob's eagerness to deflect attention raises significant concerns about his own alibi.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's clear that the overwhelming corroboration of my and Bob's alibis by Alice, combined with Dave's conflicting statements, leaves us with no choice but to prioritize the safety of the crew by voting him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I strongly believe that the consistent support for Bob's and Charlie's alibis, along with the glaring inconsistencies in Dave's story, make it imperative that we
