I need to sow more discord.  Let's say I saw Bob near Medbay, but I didn't see him *in* Medbay.  This creates doubt without directly contradicting Erin.\n\n-  I'll suggest we focus on confirming Bob's location instead of my own.  This deflects attention and plays on the uncertainty.\n\n-  If pushed further, I'll claim my memory is imperfect, but my core statement (seeing Bob near Medbay) remains true.  This uses the \"slightly off\" tactic again.\n\n-  I'll subtly imply Bob's silence is suspicious.  This plants a seed of doubt about him without explicitly accusing him.\n\n-  My final push will be to suggest a vote for Bob.  This is a risky move, but it might work if Erin and Charlie are hesitant to vote me out immediately.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I was in Electrical for a while, then saw Bob heading towards Medbay;

If there are other players in Medbay, we may need to consider who to trust and who might be an impostor. If we're alone, we can focus on completing the task and then move on to the next location.\n\nThis plan prioritizes progressing towards completing tasks while also being mindful of the social deduction aspect of the game.\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Erin, Charlie]\nRound 2\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Erin doing task Run diagnostics in medbay when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Charlie doing task Run diagnostics in medbay when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on the current game state and available actions, here's a plan for the next 3-4 steps:\n\n1. **Move to location Medbay**: This action is available and Medbay has a task that needs to be completed, which is '[TODO] | Fix wiring in medbay'. By moving to Medbay, we can start working on this task.\n2. **Fix wiring in medbay**: After moving to Medbay, we can start working on the wiring task. Completing this task will help progress towards winning the game.\n3. **Assess the situation in Medbay**: Once we're in Medbay, take a moment to observe any players who may be with us and assess the situation. This will help us get a better understanding of what's going on and make informed decisions for the next steps.\n4. **Plan the next move based on new information**: Depending on what we learn in Medbay, we can plan our next move.

We've already seen Erin and Charlie working on tasks in Medbay, and now Dave has joined us. Take a moment to gauge their behaviors and interactions.\n2. **Wait in Medbay**: For now, our action options are limited. Since we can't complete tasks in Medbay (as we've already seen others working on 'Run diagnostics'), waiting will allow us to gather more information and see how the situation develops.\n3. **Evaluate Dave's presence**: Since Dave was seen doing a task in Cafeteria earlier, their presence in Medbay might indicate a genuine need to assist or could be a ploy to blend in. Keep a close eye on Dave's behavior to determine their intentions.\n4. **Plan the next move based on new information**: After waiting and observing, reassess the situation. If no new information or suspicious behavior is noted, consider moving to Upper Engine or Cafeteria to explore and potentially complete tasks.\n\nThis plan prioritizes gathering more information about the players and their intentions, while also keeping a focus on future task completion.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

seems suspicious since Erin didn't see him in Medbay, so I think we should discuss Dave's possible actions further.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your observation about Alice entering the Cafeteria

vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Charlie's points about Dave's story being suspicious, and I'd like to add that since Dave's alibi relies on my observation of Alice, it's possible Dave was trying to manipulate the timing to create a false cover, so I think we should be cautious and not immediately accept his explanation.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point that Dave's story about seeing Bob in Medbay seems suspicious, and I agree with Erin's suggestion that Dave might have tried to manipulate the timing to create a false cover, so I think we should consider voting to eject Dave to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: My memory of the exact timing might be slightly off, but the key point is that Bob's

Discussion: [Erin]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think Dave's attempt to shift the focus away from his own suspicious behavior and onto Bob's unconfirmed whereabouts is a red flag, and we should continue to investigate Dave's actions before giving him the benefit of the doubt.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's lack of response is far more suspicious than any minor discrepancies in my timeline; let's vote him out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completely agree with Charlie's assessment, and I'd like to add that Dave's repeated attempts to deflect attention away from his own suspicious behavior onto others, such as Bob or perceived \"minor discrepancies\" in his timeline, only raise more red flags about his trustworthiness and make me even more inclined to vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I completely agree with Erin's assessment and think we have enough evidence to suggest that Dave's

rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's clear that Dave's continued attempts to deflect attention onto Bob and his lack of a solid alibi, combined with

let's vote him out.\n[Erin]: I think it's clear that Dave's continued attempts to deflect attention onto Bob and his lack of a solid alibi, combined with Charlie's and my observations of his suspicious behavior, provide sufficient evidence to justify voting him out, and I strongly believe we should do so to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Charlie]: I think we've thoroughly discussed the evidence and observations, and it's clear that the majority of us believe Dave's behavior is suspicious and warrants removal, so I propose we put it to a vote and eject Dave from the game to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Dave\n- vote for Erin\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Bob, Alice as they are already out of the game.

seems suspicious since Erin didn't see him in Medbay, so I think we should discuss Dave's possible actions further.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your observation about Alice entering the Cafeteria as I left Electrical strengthens my alibi, as it accounts for my whereabouts during the time Bob was supposedly in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Charlie's points about Dave's story being suspicious, and I'd like to add that since Dave's alibi relies on my observation of Alice, it's possible Dave was trying to manipulate the timing to create a false cover, so I think we should be cautious and not immediately accept his explanation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point

continue to investigate Dave's actions before giving him the benefit of the doubt.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's lack of response is far more suspicious than any minor discrepancies in my timeline; let's vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completely agree with Charlie's assessment, and I'd like to add that Dave's repeated attempts to deflect attention away from his own suspicious behavior onto others, such as Bob or perceived \"minor discrepancies\" in his timeline, only raise more red flags about his trustworthiness and make me even more inclined to vote him out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I completely agree with Erin's assessment and think we have enough evidence to suggest that Dave's

my discussion points as Charlie:\n\n- I agree with Erin's summary of the evidence against Dave, and I think it's clear that his behavior is suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n- Dave's repeated attempts to deflect attention onto Bob, combined with his lack of a solid alibi, raise significant red flags about his trustworthiness.\n- I think it's telling that Dave is so focused on Bob's silence, rather than addressing the concerns about his own behavior.\n- Given the evidence and observations presented, I strongly believe that voting Dave out is the best course of action to protect the remaining crewmates.\n- I'd like to ask Erin if she has any further observations or insights about Dave's behavior that might be relevant to our discussion.\n- I think it's also worth considering whether Dave's behavior could be indicative of an impostor trying to manipulate the discussion and avoid suspicion.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I was in Electrical for a while,
