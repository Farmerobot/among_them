Gathering more information can help us identify any suspicious behavior. I was in the Cafeteria earlier and saw Dave doing the \"Start the coffee maker\" task. I also saw Erin working on the \"Fix wiring in cafeteria\" task. When I left the Cafeteria, I went to the Weapons room and was alone there. I just came back from completing the \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" task. Can the rest of you share what you've been up to and what tasks you've been working on? Comparing our activities could help us spot any inconsistencies. I'm focused on completing my tasks to help the crew win.

As a crewmate, I can confirm that I saw Dave doing the \"Start the coffee maker\" task in the Cafeteria, and I also saw Erin working on the \"Fix wiring in cafeteria\" task there. When I was in the Admin room, I saw Alice working on the \"Fix wiring in admin\" task. So far, I haven't noticed any major inconsistencies in the tasks and locations I've observed. However, I think it's important that we continue to share information and compare notes, as any discrepancies or strange behavior could help us identify potential impostors. I'm happy to keep discussing our activities and observations to ensure we're all on the same page and working together to complete our tasks and win the game.]\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: [I agree with Dave and Charlie's suggestions to share our tasks and whereabouts. Comparing our activities can help us identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. I can confirm that I saw Bob working on the \"Fix wiring in admin\" task when I was in the Admin room. He seems to be making progress on his tasks as well. Earlier, I saw Dave and Erin completing tasks in the Cafeteria, which aligns with what they've shared. I'm glad to see the crew working diligently on our objectives. So far, the information we've gathered doesn't seem to point to any clear impostors. However, I think it's important that we continue to communicate openly and keep an eye out for anything unusual. My plan is to head to the Electrical room next to work on the \"Route power to defence\" task. I encourage everyone to keep me updated on their locations and activities so we can coordinate our efforts. By sharing information transparently and completing our tasks, I believe we can identify and eject any impostors while making steady progress towards winning the game.

Alice, could you please provide more details about your actions and whereabouts after leaving the Admin room? Any additional information you can share could help us establish a clearer picture of what happened. Based on the information we've gathered so far, the crew's accounts of our activities and locations seem to align. However, I agree that continuing to share our movements and task progress will be crucial for identifying any suspicious behavior or potential impostors. By working together transparently and focusing on completing our tasks, I believe we can identify and eject any impostors while making steady progress towards winning the game as a crew.]", "Discussion (5/5): round: 7.
