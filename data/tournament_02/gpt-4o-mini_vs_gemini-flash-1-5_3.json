and I didn't see anyone suspicious around me.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie and Erin in the cafeteria completing tasks, and I can confirm Erin was eliminated in Medbay, so it's important to determine who was responsible since I didn't see anyone else enter.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave and I were both in Medbay, and neither of us saw anyone else enter, let's focus on who could have moved quickly between the Cafeteria and Medbay around the time of Erin's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given my consistent presence in Admin and the confirmed sightings of Charlie and Dave in the Cafeteria, let's collaboratively reconstruct a precise timeline of movements to identify who could have swiftly traveled between the Cafeteria and Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's curious that despite being in the Cafeteria with Erin, she was found in Medbay, which suggests the impostor might have taken a route we didn't account for, so we should definitely focus on the timeline Alice suggested to see who could have moved between those locations undetected.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To clarify Charlie's statement, were you in the cafeteria constantly, or were there any moments you stepped away, even briefly?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeline of

then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial to emphasize that I was with Erin in the Cafeteria right up until her death, so I had no opportunity to eliminate her, and we should consider the possibility that the impostor could have slipped in and out of Medbay without being seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's focus on creating that timeline, prioritizing who could

timelines, the impostor could have used the vents to evade detection, which might explain the lack of sightings around Erin's death.\n- It's interesting that Bob and Dave are both keen on reconstructing a timeline, but we should also question if they had any opportunity to move undetected themselves.\n- Since I was in the Cafeteria with Erin until her death, I think it\u2019s important to focus on who else might have had access to Medbay during that time, particularly those who could have used the vents.\n- We should consider that Alice's alibi of being in Admin could be a cover, especially if she had an opportunity to move to Medbay without being seen. \n- Let's not forget that the impostor could have been someone who was not in the Cafeteria at all, which could shift our focus away from the three of us who were present there.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria the whole time doing the coffee task, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around me.\n[Dave]: I saw Charlie and Erin in the cafeteria completing tasks, and I can confirm Erin was eliminated in Medbay, so it's important to determine who was responsible since I didn't see anyone else enter.\n[Bob]: Since Dave and I were both in Medbay, and neither of us saw anyone else enter, let's focus on who could have moved quickly between the Cafeteria and Medbay around the time of Erin's death.\n[Alice]: Given my consistent presence in Admin and the confirmed sightings of Charlie and Dave in the Cafeteria, let's collaboratively reconstruct a precise timeline of movements to identify who could have swiftly traveled between the Cafeteria and Medbay.\n[Charlie]: It's curious that despite being in the Cafeteria with Erin, she was found in Medbay, which suggests the impostor might have taken a route we didn't account for, so we should definitely focus on the timeline Alice suggested to see who could have moved between those locations undetected.\n[Dave]: To clarify Charlie's statement, were you in the cafeteria constantly, or were there any moments you stepped away, even briefly?\n[Bob]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeline of everyone's movements from the last time they saw Erin in the cafeteria until her body was discovered in Medbay, paying close attention to potential unseen routes.\n[Alice]: To help create that timeline, I was in Admin from the last time I saw Erin in the cafeteria until the body was reported, eliminating me as a suspect.\n[Charlie]: I think it's crucial to emphasize that I was with Erin in the Cafeteria right up until her death, so I had no opportunity to eliminate her, and we should consider the possibility that the impostor could have slipped in and out of Medbay without being seen.\n[Dave]: Let's focus on creating that timeline, prioritizing who could have traveled between the Cafeteria and Medbay undetected, and then we can discuss next steps based on the information we gather.\n[Bob]: To effectively pinpoint the Impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline of everyone's movements between the last sighting of Erin in the Cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, noting any potential blind spots or less-traveled routes.\n[Alice]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously document the precise times each of us was in each room, focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying particular attention to any potential unseen routes or lapses in observation.\n[Charlie]: I agree that reconstructing the timeline is essential, but we should also consider that the impostor might have cleverly used the vent system to evade detection and move between the Cafeteria and Medbay quickly, which could explain how they managed to eliminate Erin without being seen.\n[Dave]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying close attention to potential unseen routes, including the vents.\n[Bob]: Okay, let's focus on Charlie's precise timeframe in the cafeteria before Erin's death to pinpoint the window of opportunity for the Impostor, and then we can cross-reference that with Alice's Admin timeline and consider the vent system's potential use.\n[Alice]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeframe for each person's location, starting from the last confirmed sighting of Erin in the Cafeteria and ending with the discovery of her body in Medbay, to eliminate inconsistencies.\n[Charlie]: I think we should also consider that while we're focused on timelines, the impostor may have used the vents to move undetected, which complicates our

Impostor\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- It's interesting that Erin was last seen in the Cafeteria with me, and now both she and Dave are out of the game. We should consider how quickly the impostor could have moved between rooms, possibly using the vents.\n- I was in the Cafeteria the entire time, and I can confirm that I didn't see anyone suspicious. My consistent presence there might help eliminate me as a suspect.\n- We should also think about how the impostor might have manipulated the timeline to create confusion. It's crucial to analyze who had the opportunity to move undetected, especially since Dave was last seen moving to Medbay.\n- Given that Alice was in Admin and has been consistently accounted for, it might be worth scrutinizing Bob's movements more closely since he was with Dave in Medbay.\n- I believe we need to focus on the fact that the impostor could have used the vent system to avoid detection, which complicates our ability to trace their movements accurately. This could shift suspicion back towards those who had access to the vents.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria the whole time doing the coffee task, and I didn't see anyone

Points:\n- I think we should pivot the discussion towards the vent system, as it could be a crucial element in identifying the impostor. Both Bob and Dave had access to Medbay, which raises the possibility that one of them could have used the vents to evade detection.\n- While I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, it's important to reiterate that I had no opportunity to eliminate her. We should focus on those who had the chance to move between the Cafeteria and Medbay, especially if they could have done so undetected.\n- Let's consider the timeline and how quickly someone could have moved from the Cafeteria to Medbay. If Bob and Dave were both in Medbay and didn't see anyone enter, it points to the likelihood of vent usage.\n- I propose we ask Bob and Dave to clarify their movements during the critical time frame. This could help us determine if they had any opportunity to utilize the vents or if they were genuinely occupied in Medbay.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria the whole time

doing the coffee task, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around me.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie and Erin in the cafeteria completing tasks, and I can confirm Erin was eliminated in Medbay, so it's important to determine who was responsible since I didn't see anyone else enter.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave and I were both in Medbay, and neither of us saw anyone else enter, let's focus on who could have moved quickly between the Cafeteria and Medbay around the time of Erin's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given my consistent presence in Admin and the confirmed sightings of Charlie and Dave in the Cafeteria, let's collaboratively reconstruct a precise timeline of movements to identify who could have swiftly traveled between the Cafeteria and Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's curious that despite being in the Cafeteria with Erin, she was found in Medbay, which suggests the impostor might have taken a route we didn't account for, so we should definitely focus on the timeline Alice suggested to see who could have moved between those locations undetected.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To clarify Charlie's statement, were you in the cafeteria constantly, or were there any moments you stepped away, even briefly?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeline of everyone's movements from the last time they saw Erin in the cafeteria until her body was discovered in Medbay, paying close attention to potential unseen routes.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: To help create that timeline, I was in Admin from the last time I saw Erin in the cafeteria until the body was reported, eliminating me as a suspect.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial to emphasize that I was with Erin in the Cafeteria right up until her death, so I had no opportunity to eliminate her, and we should consider the possibility that the impostor could have slipped in and out of Medbay without being seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's focus on creating that timeline, prioritizing who could have traveled between the Cafeteria and Medbay undetected, and then we can discuss next steps based on the information we gather.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: To effectively pinpoint the Impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline of everyone's movements between the last sighting of Erin in the Cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, noting any potential blind spots or less-traveled routes.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously document the precise times each of us was in each room, focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying particular attention to any potential unseen routes or lapses in observation.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree that reconstructing the timeline is essential, but we should also consider that the impostor might have cleverly used the vent system to evade detection and move between the Cafeteria and Medbay quickly, which could explain how they managed to eliminate Erin without being seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying close attention to potential unseen routes, including the vents.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Okay, let's focus on Charlie's precise timeframe in the cafeteria before Erin's death to pinpoint the window of opportunity for the Impostor, and then we can cross-reference that with Alice's Admin timeline and consider the vent system's potential use.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeframe for each person's location, starting from the last confirmed sighting of Erin in the Cafeteria and ending with the discovery of her body in Medbay, to eliminate inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider that while we're focused on timelines, the impostor may have used the vents to move undetected, which complicates our investigation and could explain why neither Dave nor Bob saw anyone else enter Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay,

death, so I had no opportunity to eliminate her, and we should consider the possibility that the impostor could have slipped in and out of Medbay without being seen.\n[Dave]: Let's focus on creating that timeline, prioritizing who could have traveled between the Cafeteria and Medbay undetected, and then we can discuss next steps based on the information we gather.\n[Bob]: To effectively pinpoint the Impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline of everyone's movements between the last sighting of Erin in the Cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, noting any potential blind

sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying particular attention to any potential unseen routes or lapses in observation.\n[Charlie]: I agree that reconstructing the

Were there *any* moments, however brief, when they left the cafeteria?  Even a short absence could be crucial.\n\n-  Let's focus on establishing a definitive timeline, including vent access points, for everyone's movements between Erin's last sighting and the discovery of her body.  This needs to be collaborative; we need precise times and locations from each person.\n\n-  While vent usage is a possibility, let's not solely focus on that.  We need to account for all possible routes and consider inconsistencies in reported times and locations.  Even without vents, a quick trip between locations is possible.\n\n-  I was in Medbay with Dave; neither of us saw anyone enter. This significantly limits the suspects, and points to someone who could have moved quickly and undetected between the cafeteria and Medbay.

This will help us corroborate your statement with the timeline.\n\n- I agree that vent access is a crucial factor.  Let's list who had access to the vents and when, to see if this aligns with the timeline and potential opportunities.\n\n- While we focus on the timeline, let's not forget to consider other factors.  Were there any unusual noises or distractions that could have masked the Impostor's actions?\n\n- Since a tie vote occurred, it\u2019s crucial to focus on gathering more concrete evidence before the next vote.  Let's meticulously examine the timeline and vent access to avoid another stalemate.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria the whole time doing the coffee task, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around me.\n[Dave]: I saw Charlie and Erin in the cafeteria completing tasks, and I can confirm Erin was eliminated in Medbay, so it's important to determine who was responsible since I didn't see anyone else enter.\n[Bob]: Since Dave and I were both in Medbay, and neither of us saw anyone else enter, let's focus on who could have moved quickly between the Cafeteria and Medbay around the time of Erin's death.\n[Alice]: Given my consistent presence in Admin and the confirmed sightings of Charlie and Dave in the Cafeteria, let's collaboratively reconstruct a precise timeline of movements to identify who could have swiftly traveled between the Cafeteria and Medbay.\n[Charlie]: It's curious that despite being in the Cafeteria with Erin, she was found in Medbay, which suggests the impostor might have taken a route we didn't account for, so we should definitely focus on the timeline Alice suggested to see who could have moved between those locations undetected.\n[Dave]: To clarify Charlie's statement, were you in the cafeteria constantly, or were there any moments you stepped away, even briefly?\n[Bob]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeline of everyone's movements from the last time they saw Erin in the cafeteria until her body was discovered in Medbay, paying close attention to potential unseen routes.\n[Alice]: To help create that timeline, I was in Admin from the last time I saw Erin in the cafeteria until the body was reported, eliminating me as a suspect.\n[Charlie]: I think it's crucial to emphasize that I was with Erin in the Cafeteria right up until her death, so I had no opportunity to eliminate her, and we should consider the possibility that the impostor could have slipped in and out of Medbay without being seen.\n[Dave]: Let's focus on creating that timeline, prioritizing who could have traveled between the Cafeteria and Medbay undetected, and then we can discuss next steps based on the information we gather.\n[Bob]: To effectively pinpoint the Impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline of everyone's movements between the last sighting of Erin in the Cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, noting any potential blind spots or less-traveled routes.\n[Alice]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously document the precise times each of us was in each room, focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying particular attention to any potential unseen routes or lapses in observation.\n[Charlie]: I agree that reconstructing the timeline is essential, but we should also consider that the impostor might have cleverly used the vent system to evade detection and move between the Cafeteria and Medbay quickly, which could explain how they managed to eliminate Erin without being seen.\n[Dave]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying close attention to potential unseen routes, including the vents.\n[Bob]: Okay, let's focus on Charlie's precise timeframe in the cafeteria before Erin's death to pinpoint the window of opportunity for the Impostor, and then we can cross-reference that with Alice's Admin timeline and consider the vent system's potential use.\n[Alice]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeframe for each person's location, starting from the last confirmed sighting of Erin in the Cafeteria and ending with the discovery of her body in Medbay, to eliminate inconsistencies.\n[Charlie]: I think we should also consider that while we're focused on timelines, the impostor may have used the vents to move

body, noting vent access and any discrepancies in reported times.\n[Charlie]: It's worth noting that while we're diligently reconstructing timelines, the impostor could have easily utilized the vent system to slip between the Cafeteria and Medbay undetected, which might explain the lack of sightings and could point the finger back towards those with vent access.\n[Bob]: Given the consistent focus on timelines, let's prioritize verifying Charlie's claim of continuous presence in the cafeteria by asking for specific details about their actions during that period.\n[Alice]: To effectively identify the Impostor, let's compare each person's precise location and activities between Erin's last sighting and the discovery of her body, considering vent access and potential blind spots.\n[Charlie]: I find it intriguing that while we're focused on timelines, we might be overlooking the possibility that either Bob or Dave, both of whom had access to Medbay, could have used the vents to evade detection, which would explain why they didn't see anyone else enter.\n[Bob]: Let's prioritize verifying Charlie's account of his activities in the cafeteria by requesting specific

Did anyone see anyone enter or leave Medbay during that time?\n\n-  I was in Weapons when Bob was completing a task.  Can Bob confirm this, and can anyone else corroborate their location during this crucial period?\n\n-  Since the vent system has been mentioned repeatedly, let's consider which rooms have vent access and who was near those vents during the relevant times.  This might help us narrow down the suspects.\n\n-  Let's focus our discussion on specific times and locations, avoiding general statements.  Precise details are crucial to identifying inconsistencies.\n\n-  We need to determine if there are any discrepancies between reported times and locations.

Let's list who had access to the vents and when, to see if this aligns with the timeline and potential opportunities.\n\n- While we focus on the timeline, let's not forget to consider other factors.  Were there any unusual noises or distractions that could have masked the Impostor's actions?\n\n- Since a tie vote occurred, it\u2019s crucial to focus on gathering more concrete evidence before the next vote.

Can you provide more specific details about your actions, Charlie?  What tasks were you performing, and were there any moments you stepped away, even briefly?  Precise details are crucial for building an accurate timeline.\n\n-  To further refine our timeline, let's note the exact times each of us saw Erin last in the cafeteria and when her body was discovered in Medbay.  This will help us identify potential inconsistencies and narrow down the window of opportunity for the Impostor.\n\n- Since Bob and Dave were both in Medbay and didn't see anyone enter, let's focus on individuals who could have used the vents to move between the Cafeteria and Medbay undetected.

time they saw Erin in the cafeteria until her body was discovered in Medbay, paying close attention to potential unseen routes.\n[Alice]: To help create that timeline, I was in Admin from the last time I saw Erin in the cafeteria until the body was reported, eliminating me as a suspect.\n[Charlie]: I think it's crucial to emphasize that I was with Erin in the Cafeteria right up until her death, so I had no opportunity to eliminate her, and we should consider the possibility that the impostor could have slipped in and out of Medbay without being seen.\n[Dave]: Let's focus on creating that timeline, prioritizing who could have traveled between the Cafeteria and Medbay undetected, and then we can discuss next steps based on the information we gather.\n[Bob]: To effectively pinpoint the Impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline of everyone's movements between the last sighting of Erin in the Cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, noting any potential blind spots or less-traveled routes.\n[Alice]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously document the precise times each of us was in each room, focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying particular attention to any potential unseen routes or lapses in observation.\n[Charlie]: I agree that reconstructing the timeline is essential, but we should also consider that the impostor might have cleverly used the vent system to evade detection and move between the Cafeteria and Medbay quickly, which could explain how they managed to eliminate Erin without being seen.\n[Dave]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying close attention to potential unseen routes, including the vents.\n[Bob]: Okay, let's focus on Charlie's precise timeframe in the cafeteria before Erin's death to pinpoint the window of opportunity for the Impostor, and then we can cross-reference that with Alice's Admin timeline and consider the vent system's potential use.\n[Alice]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeframe for each person's location, starting from the last confirmed sighting of Erin in the Cafeteria and ending with the discovery of her body in Medbay, to eliminate inconsistencies.\n[Charlie]: I think we should also consider that while we're focused on timelines, the impostor may have used the vents to move undetected, which complicates our investigation and could explain why neither Dave nor Bob saw anyone else enter Medbay.\n[Dave]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously reconstruct a timeline focusing on the period between Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria and the discovery of her body in Medbay, paying close attention to potential unseen routes, including the vents, and noting any discrepancies in reported times.\n[Bob]: To solve this, let's create a shared timeline, starting with the last confirmed sighting of Erin and ending with the discovery of her body, noting any potential gaps or inconsistencies.\n[Alice]: To effectively pinpoint the imposter, let's collaboratively create a precise timeline of everyone's movements from Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria to the discovery of her body in Medbay, meticulously documenting times and locations, and considering the possibility of vent usage.\n[Charlie]: While we focus on timelines, it's crucial to remember that the impostor could have easily used the vents to evade detection, which might explain the lack of sightings around Erin's death and shift our suspicion towards those who had access to the vent system.\n[Bob]: Let's create a shared, minute-by-minute timeline from Erin's last sighting in the cafeteria to the discovery of her body in Medbay, noting vent access and any discrepancies.\n[Alice]: To efficiently identify the Impostor, let's collaboratively create a precise, time-stamped timeline of everyone's movements from Erin's last sighting to the discovery of her body, noting vent access and any discrepancies in reported times.\n[Charlie]: It's worth noting that while we're diligently reconstructing timelines, the impostor could have easily utilized the vent system to slip between the Cafeteria and Medbay undetected, which might explain the lack of sightings and could point the finger back towards those with vent access.\n[Bob]: Given the consistent focus on timelines, let's prioritize verifying Charlie's claim of continuous presence in the cafeteria by asking for specific details about their actions during that period.\n[Alice]: To effectively identify the Impostor, let's compare each person's precise location and activities between Erin's last sighting and the discovery of her body, considering vent access and potential blind spots.\n[Charlie]: I find it intriguing that while we're focused on timelines, we might be overlooking the possibility that either Bob or Dave, both of whom had access to Medbay, could have used the vents to evade detection, which would explain why they didn't see anyone else enter.\n[Bob]: Let's prioritize verifying Charlie's account of his activities in the cafeteria by requesting specific details about his tasks and any potential brief absences, then cross-reference this with a minute-by-minute timeline of everyone's movements, including vent access.\n[Alice]: To effectively identify the Impostor, let's
