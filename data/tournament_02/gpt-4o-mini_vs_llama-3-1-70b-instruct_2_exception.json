I didn't see Alice doing any tasks in Medbay, which makes her movement even more suspicious now that Charlie is dead.\n- Bob raised a good point about Charlie's movements; however, we need to focus on Alice since she was the last one seen near him.

Here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1. **Move to location Medbay**: Medbay has a submit scan task with a deadline of 2 turns left. Prioritizing this task will help us make progress and narrow down our options for the next turn.\n2. **Submit scan in Medbay**: Once in Medbay, complete the submit scan task to eliminate the time constraint and free up future turns for other tasks.\n3. **Observe and discuss**: After completing the task in Medbay, observe the reactions and actions of the other players, especially those who followed you to Medbay. Use this opportunity to gather information and discuss with others to identify potential impostors.\n\nThis plan focuses on making progress on the tasks, while also allowing us to gather information about other players' actions and intentions.\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRounds 14-15\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed Alice moved to Medbay from Upper Engine, which raises some questions about her intentions; perhaps we should keep a closer eye on her movements moving forward.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Dave's point about Alice's movement, but let's not jump to conclusions yet, and instead, I'd like to hear from Charlie about his rapid room-hopping, as it's been mentioned before and seems just as suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concerns about my movement by explaining that I was simply following the original plan we had, which was to move to Medbay to work on the diagnostics task, and I'd appreciate it if we could focus on gathering more information from others, like Charlie, before making any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, while I appreciate your explanation about following the plan, I still find it odd that you were last seen near Charlie, and we should definitely hear from Erin and others to clarify everyone's movements before we make any decisions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to follow up on Dave's point about Alice's movement and Charlie's rapid room-hopping; it's essential to gather more information about everyone's actions and intentions before making any accusations.\n\n(Note: Since I'm Bob, I'm reiterating one of my previous discussion points to keep the conversation on track and to emphasize the importance of gathering more information before making any accusations.)\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's crucial to consider Dave's involvement near Medbay, where Charlie's body was found, and I'd like to ask him to provide a clear explanation of his actions and intentions around the time of Charlie's death, as his proximity to the scene raises more suspicion than my adherence to the original plan.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_SECURITY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I noticed Alice moved to Medbay from Upper Engine, which raises some questions about her intentions; perhaps we should keep a closer eye on her movements moving forward.\n[Bob]: I agree with Dave's point about Alice's movement, but let's not jump to conclusions yet, and instead, I'd like to hear from Charlie about his rapid room-hopping, as it's been mentioned before and seems just as suspicious.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concerns about my movement by explaining that I was simply following the original plan we had, which was to move to Medbay to work on the diagnostics task, and I'd appreciate it if we could focus on gathering more information from others, like Charlie, before making any accusations.\n[Dave]: Alice, while I appreciate your explanation about following the plan, I still find it odd that you were last seen near Charlie, and we should definitely hear from Erin and others to clarify everyone's movements before we make any decisions.\n[Bob]: I'd like to follow up on Dave's point about Alice's movement and Charlie's rapid room-hopping; it's essential to gather more information about everyone's actions and intentions before making any accusations.\n\n(Note: Since I'm Bob, I'm reiterating one of my previous discussion points to keep the conversation on track and to emphasize the importance of gathering more information before making any accusations.)\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial to consider Dave's involvement near Medbay, where Charlie's body was found, and I'd like to ask him to provide a clear explanation of his actions and intentions around the time of Charlie's death, as his proximity to the scene raises more suspicion than my adherence to the original plan.\n[Dave]: Alice's insistence on my involvement seems more like a deflection from her own suspicious movements near Charlie; I was alone in the Cafeteria for several rounds, so let's focus on her actions instead.\n", "\nYou are Bob in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nHere are my discussion points as Bob:\n\n- I think we should keep the discussion focused on gathering more information about everyone's actions and intentions, rather than jumping to conclusions or making accusations. We should prioritize understanding the big picture before making any decisions.\n- It's true that Alice was last seen near Medbay, but we also need to consider Dave's proximity to Medbay when Charlie's body was found. Alice has asked Dave to provide a clear explanation of his actions and intentions, and I agree that we should hear him out before making any further accusations.\n- I'd like to reiterate my previous point about Charlie's rapid room-hopping, as it still seems suspicious to me. However, since Charlie is now deceased, we should focus on gathering more information from the remaining players, including Erin, about their movements and actions.\n- I think we should also consider the fact that Alice was following the original plan to move to Medbay for diagnostics. While her movement may seem suspicious, we should be cautious not to misinterpret her actions and give her the benefit of the doubt until we have more information.\n- I'd like to ask Erin and other players to provide more information about their movements and actions in the last few rounds, as their input could be crucial in helping us identify potential impostors.\n- Before we vote, let's summarize the information we have so far and try to piece together a timeline of events. This will help us make a more informed decision about who to eject from the game.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I noticed Alice moved to Medbay from Upper Engine, which raises some questions about her intentions;
