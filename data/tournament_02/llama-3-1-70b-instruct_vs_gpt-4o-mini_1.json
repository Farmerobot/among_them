Avoid (`move to location Weapons`) which could provoke unneeded, additional discussion based on being too direct regarding intentions (for this session). \n \n\nFor location, in the future:\nIf all players appear willing to reveal actions openly.

make a more informed decision.\n", "\nYou are Bob in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nHere are my discussion points as Bob, the Impostor:\n\n- I think it's time to summarize the key points we've discussed so far: Dave's alibi in Admin is questionable, and Erin's confirmation of the coffee maker task is crucial in determining the validity of his claims.\n- I'd like to reiterate that Dave's repeated claims of being in Admin the whole time, yet not seeing anyone else, seem suspicious and contradictory, which raises concerns about his memory or potential deception.\n- Since Erin is the only one who can provide clarity on the coffee maker task and Dave's interaction with her, I suggest we give her the opportunity to share her insights and observations, which could either support or challenge Dave's alibi.\n- I agree with Charlie and Alice that Erin's input is essential in making an informed decision, and I urge her to share what she knows to help us piece together the timeline and determine the validity of Dave's claims.\n- Considering the growing concerns about Dave's alibi, I think it's reasonable to consider the possibility that he might be hiding something or trying to deflect suspicion, which could be a sign of impostor behavior.\n- I'd like to propose that we focus on verifying Dave's alibi and gathering more information before making any hasty decisions, as it's crucial to ensure we're making an informed decision about who to trust and who to eject from the game.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I'd like to add to my previous question, has anyone seen Dave since he moved to Admin, and can Erin confirm if they actually completed the coffee maker task or just started it, because I only saw them initiate it but didn't stick around to see the result?\n[Charlie]: I can confirm that I saw Alice in Medbay running diagnostics, which suggests she was occupied with a task, but we really need Erin to clarify her interaction with Dave since I haven't seen him since he moved to Admin either.\n[Alice]: I appreciate Charlie's confirmation of my presence in Medbay, and Bob, your question about Dave is essential; Erin, could you please clarify what you observed with him to help us piece together the timeline?\n[Dave]: I was in Admin the whole time working on my tasks and can confirm that I

truth or trying to deflect suspicion.\n[Alice]: Erin, your insights about your interaction with Dave are vital, as they could help us confirm or challenge his claims about being in Admin and clarify the timeline for everyone involved.\n[Dave]: I understand the scrutiny on my alibi, but I assure you I was focused on my tasks in Admin, and Erin's clarification on the coffee maker task is essential for us to accurately assess everyone's movements and avoid making hasty decisions.\n[Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Dave keeps saying he was in Admin the whole time, yet claims he didn't see anyone else after leaving the Cafeteria, which could be a contradictory statement if he's indeed been alone in Admin, don't you think we should question his memory of the events or consider the possibility that he's hiding something?\n[Charlie]: I find it concerning that Dave insists he was in Admin the whole time without seeing anyone, and Erin's observations on the coffee maker task could either validate or undermine his claims, so I urge her to share what she knows.\n[Alice]: I agree with the growing concerns about Dave's alibi, and Erin, your input on the coffee maker task is

Given that Erin has been killed and Dave was voted off, this allows you to gather information on the dynamics and possible alibis of the other players. Action: `wait in Cafeteria`\n\n2. **Pretend a task to fit in**: To avoid drawing suspicion to yourself, you should appear to be actively working on a task to blend in. Action: `pretend doing task: Fix wiring in cafeteria` This creates the illusion of productivity.\n\n3. **Plan and move strategically**: Based on the new dynamic and to get closer to your ultimate objective, evaluate the player distribution and possibilities for ambush or isolation to eliminate crewmates. At this time, the possibilities are limited because you are stuck in one of the main rooms until you make further moves. With this action choice, pick one location closest to achieving your goals safely. After considering this for the previous step, perform the new action.\n\nOne of 3 location Actions:\n1. **Safe approach choice**: If cautious, observe players that haven't communicated their intentions thoroughly. Try moving towards that location closest to an advantage for gaining upper hand secretly. e.g., (`move to location Medbay`.)\n\n2.  **Daring but still viable**: Observe who communicates the action they performed when you first saw Dave suspiciously avoiding discussion of that task: e.g. (`move to location Admin`).\n3. Avoid (`move to location Weapons`) which could provoke unneeded, additional discussion based on being too direct regarding intentions (for this session). \n \n\nFor location, in the future:\nIf all players appear willing to reveal actions openly.

This will help me understand the crewmates' dynamics and make informed decisions for the next round.\n3. **Prepare to move to Admin**: Depending on the vote outcome, if Dave gets eliminated, it might be an excellent opportunity to move to Admin and pretend to work on tasks, potentially gaining the trust of the remaining crewmates.\n4. **Consider eliminating Charlie or Alice**: If the vote doesn't go in my favor, or if I need to create a distraction, I'll consider eliminating either Charlie or Alice, as they seem to be the most suspicious of Dave's alibi and might be more likely to investigate further.\n\nThis plan allows me to stay informed, adapt to the vote outcome, and prepare for potential future actions to further my impostor objectives.", "wait in cafeteria", "Here is a plan for the next objective:\n\n1. **Observe and adjust**: Remain in the Cafeteria to observe the scene and listen for any updates or comments from other players.

Avoid (`move to location Weapons`) which could provoke unneeded, additional discussion based on being too direct regarding intentions (for this session). \n \n\nFor location, in the future:\nIf all players appear willing to reveal actions openly.
