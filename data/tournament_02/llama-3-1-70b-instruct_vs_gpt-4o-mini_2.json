Since I'm currently alone in the Cafeteria, I need to make the most of this situation. Here's a plan to achieve my objective:\n\n**Step 1: Wait in Cafeteria**\nI will wait for a crewmate to enter the Cafeteria, as this will give me an opportunity to observe their actions and identify a potential target.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate the crewmate (if possible)**\nIf a crewmate enters the Cafeteria, I will eliminate them if I can do so without raising suspicion. Since I'm currently alone, this might be a good opportunity to strike.\n\n**Step 3: Report the dead body (if necessary)**\nIf I eliminate a crewmate, I will report the dead body to blend in with the crewmates and gain their trust. This will make it less likely for them to suspect me of being an impostor.\n\n**Step 4: Move to a new location (if necessary)**\nIf I've eliminated a crewmate and reported the dead body, I will move to a new location (such as Medbay, Admin, or Weapons) to avoid suspicion and gather more information about the other players.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- report dead body of Erin\n- report dead body of Dave\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\n- pretend doing task: Empty the cafeteria trash\n- pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\n- pretend doing task: Fix wiring in cafeteria\n"], "actions": ["wait in Cafeteria", "report dead body of Erin", "report dead body of Dave", "move to location Medbay", "move to location Admin", "move to location Weapons", "pretend doing task: Empty the cafeteria trash", "pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria", "pretend doing task: Fix wiring in cafeteria"], "response": "0", "action_result": "You [Alice] are waiting in Cafeteria", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "You are alone in the room", "observations": [], "chat_messages": []}, {"location": "Cafeteria", "stage": "Discuss", "life": "Alive", "tasks": [{"name": "Eliminate all crewmates", "completed": false, "location": "Unknown"}], "llm_responses": ["Here are some discussion points as Alice (Impostor):\n\n- I've noticed that Bob and Charlie were in the Admin room earlier, but I haven't seen them since.
