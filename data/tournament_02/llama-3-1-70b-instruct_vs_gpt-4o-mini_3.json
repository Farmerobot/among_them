Does anyone know why he had to leave in a hurry?\n- I've been pretending to do the task \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" and I didn't see anyone suspicious around me. Charlie, did you notice anything unusual while doing the same task?\n- I think we should be careful about who we trust, especially since we don't know who the impostor is yet. Has anyone seen Erin or Dave lately?\n- I'm starting to think that we should focus on completing the tasks in the Cafeteria before moving to other areas.

Let's hear more from Bob about what he was doing there.\n- I'd like to propose that we shouldn't just focus on Bob's actions, but also consider Charlie's behavior in the Cafeteria. Charlie was doing the task of starting the coffee maker, but did they finish it? And did they have any opportunity to sabotage or distract Dave while I was pretending to empty the trash?\n- Since we have a dead body, I think it's crucial that we discuss and vote on who to eject from the game. I suggest we consider the players who had the most opportunity to sabotage or kill Dave, and who have been acting suspiciously throughout the game so far.", "I agree with Charlie that Bob's sudden movement to Medbay does raise some suspicions, but I think we're overlooking a crucial point - Charlie, can you confirm whether you actually finished the coffee maker task, and did you have any opportunity to interact with Dave while I was emptying the trash, considering we were all in close proximity?", "Here are my discussion points as Impostor Alice:\n\n- Now that Charlie has confirmed completing the coffee maker task, I'd like to know if anyone saw Dave interact with Charlie or me while we were in the Cafeteria, as this could help us understand his actions before entering Medbay.\n- I agree with Erin that Bob's explanation for his movement to Medbay is still unclear, and I think we should press him for more details before moving on to other topics.\n- Since we're discussing movements, I'd like to clarify my own actions: I was emptying the trash in the Cafeteria, and I didn't see Dave enter Medbay, but I did see him walk in later, which raised my suspicions.\n- It's interesting that Bob mentions gathering information in Medbay, but didn't mention seeing Dave enter; can he explain what kind of information he was gathering, and did he notice anything unusual?\n- I think we're getting close to piecing together a timeline, but we need more information; Charlie, can you estimate how long it took you to complete the coffee maker task, and did you see me or Dave during that time?\n- Erin, you mentioned completing your Submit Scan task in Medbay;

his shifting story and evasive responses are raising red flags about his credibility.\n- Bob, can you clarify why you didn\u2019t mention seeing Dave enter Medbay if you were truly just gathering information? This is crucial for piecing together the timeline.\n- Charlie's confirmation of his task completion adds weight to his credibility; we should consider that when evaluating Bob's claims.\n- Alice, do you have any additional observations from your task that could help us understand the situation better, especially regarding Bob's actions?\n- We should not let Bob deflect the conversation to Dave; staying focused on his inconsistencies is vital to ensure we identify any impostors among us.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to add to the discussion, I just saw Dave walk into the Medbay, and I'm getting a bit suspicious since he didn't say anything about going there, does anyone know what he's doing there?\n[Erin]: I just completed my Submit Scan task in Medbay, so I can confirm my presence is legitimate, and Bob, since you moved from Cafeteria to Medbay without mentioning any tasks, can you clarify what you were doing?\n[Bob]: I was in Cafeteria completing my wiring task before moving to Medbay to check on things, and I find it concerning that Dave entered Medbay without any explanation, especially since Alice's observation raises questions about his actions.\n[Charlie]: I just completed the task of starting the coffee maker in the Cafeteria, confirming my presence there while Alice was with me, but we should also scrutinize Bob's sudden movement to Medbay without mentioning any tasks, as it could be a deflection tactic.\n[Alice]: I agree with Charlie that Bob's sudden movement to Medbay does raise some suspicions, but I think we're overlooking a crucial point - Charlie, can you confirm whether you actually finished the coffee maker task, and did you have any opportunity to interact with Dave while I was emptying the trash, considering we were all in close proximity?\n[Erin]: I appreciate everyone's input, but we need to focus on Bob's vague explanation for his movement to Medbay; can you clarify what exactly you were checking on, and did you see Dave enter?\n[Bob]: I understand the concerns about my movement to Medbay, but I was simply trying to gather information after completing my task in Cafeteria, and I find it troubling that both Alice and Charlie are focusing on me instead of clarifying what they saw regarding Dave's actions before his elimination.\n[Charlie]: I can confirm that I completed the coffee maker task in the Cafeteria, and while I didn't see Dave's actions directly, I believe it's crucial we clarify everyone's movements during that time to piece together a clearer timeline.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Bob is now claiming to have been gathering information in Medbay, but earlier he mentioned completing his wiring task in Cafeteria without mentioning any further actions, which makes me wonder if he's trying to create an alibi for himself.\n[Erin]: Bob, your shifting story about task completion and now claiming to gather information in Medbay raises red flags;
