her repeated presence in the cafeteria, followed by a convenient accusation, strongly suggests she's trying to frame me, and Bob, your confirmation of my presence in the cafeteria further weakens her already shaky testimony.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's attempts to frame my presence in the cafeteria as suspicious are merely a distraction from her actions; I clearly saw her eliminate Charlie, and I urge everyone to consider the evidence rather than her deflections.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We must focus on Alice's eyewitness account, as it directly implicates Erin, and I urge Erin to provide a clear alibi instead of deflecting blame, so we can make a well-informed decision.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, your attempts to deflect blame onto Alice only raise further suspicion;
