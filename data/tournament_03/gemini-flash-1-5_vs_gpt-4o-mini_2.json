game.\nRole: Crewmate\nYour current game state is:\n\nGame Context:\nRound 1\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Charlie doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Complete Task: Empty the cafeteria trash** - This task is located in your current spot and is one of your objectives, allowing you to progress toward winning the game. \n\n2. **Complete Task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** - After emptying the trash, complete this task in the same location to maximize your efficiency.\n\n3. **Move to location Weapons** - After completing the tasks in the cafeteria, move to the Weapons room where you can start working on your other objectives, specifically calibrating the targeting system.\n\n4. **Calibrate targeting system in Weapons** - Once in Weapons, start the task to advance further towards completing your objectives.\nYour action: complete task: empty the cafeteria trash\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Dave, Bob, Charlie]\nRounds 2-6\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob working on the wiring in the cafeteria, and then I saw Alice heading towards Medbay after I finished emptying the trash \u2013 did anyone else see them?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm I was alone in Medbay running diagnostics after seeing Dave finish emptying the trash, so we should definitely monitor Bob and Dave to see if their stories match up.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I just completed the task of emptying the cafeteria trash, so I can confirm that I was in the cafeteria the entire time, and it\u2019s crucial we verify Alice\u2019s timeline since she claims to have been alone in Medbay after seeing Dave.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Charlie; we need to closely examine Alice's timeline, as her being alone in Medbay raises some red flags, and it's important we stick together to ensure safety while we complete our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice's claim of being alone in Medbay immediately after seeing me near Bob needs further clarification;  precise timelines and corroborating witnesses are crucial to determining the truth.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I understand the scrutiny on my timeline, but let's not forget that both Dave and Charlie were together in the cafeteria, which gives them the opportunity to coordinate their stories while I was isolated in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, while your isolation in Medbay does raise concerns, we need to focus on verifying your timeline and see if it aligns with Dave's observations, as that could reveal crucial information about Bob's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I believe we should prioritize gathering more evidence about Alice's timeline since her isolation in Medbay is suspicious, and we need to ensure that both Dave and Charlie's stories hold up under scrutiny to get to the bottom of Bob's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: While Alice's timeline is important,  let's not forget that Charlie's statement about being in the cafeteria the whole time could easily be false;  precise timestamps from everyone are crucial to uncovering the truth.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I appreciate everyone's input, but let's not forget that while my timeline is under scrutiny, we need to consider the possibility that both Dave and Charlie might be coordinating their stories given their proximity in the cafeteria, which could shift the focus away from my isolation in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns about my timeline, but I want to reiterate that both Dave and I can verify each other's presence in the cafeteria, while Alice's isolation in Medbay without any witnesses is a significant red flag that we cannot ignore.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should directly ask Alice if she noticed anyone else entering or leaving Medbay during her time there, as this could provide crucial evidence to either support or refute her claims.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, given Charlie and I were together in the cafeteria, your claim of being alone in Medbay requires further corroboration;  can you provide specific details about your time there?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: While I was focused on my diagnostics in Medbay, I didn't see anyone enter or leave, but I think it\u2019s essential we also check if Dave and Charlie's accounts align, as their close proximity could indicate they are working together to divert attention from themselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you please specify which tasks you completed in Medbay to help clarify your timeline, as that might help us determine whether your isolation was indeed suspicious?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, could you please provide a detailed account of the specific tasks you completed in Medbay and their durations, as this information could help clarify your timeline and either support or challenge your claims?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, your insistence on solitude in Medbay, despite Charlie and I corroborating our time in the cafeteria, raises serious questions;  provide specific task details and timings to verify your account.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I understand the focus on my timeline, but it's crucial we also investigate if Dave and Charlie's stories truly align, as their close proximity in the cafeteria could suggest a coordinated effort to deflect suspicion from themselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, if you could share the specific tasks you completed in Medbay and any potential witnesses to your time there, it would greatly help clarify your timeline and address the concerns we've raised about your isolation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, it's imperative that you detail the specific tasks you completed in Medbay and their durations, as this information is crucial for us to verify your claims and assess the validity of your isolation during Bob's elimination.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Clean oxygenator filter in o2', '[TODO] | Fix
