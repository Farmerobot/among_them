whole time pretending to empty the trash, and I saw Dave, Charlie, and Alice all working on tasks \u2013 Bob, where were you?\n[Bob]: I think Erin's explanation about pretending to empty the trash is suspicious, and I'd like to know more about what she was actually doing during that time, especially since I saw her just standing there without actually emptying the trash.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Bob that Erin's explanation is suspicious, and I think we should press her for more information about what she was doing during that time, especially since I saw her initially start the task but didn't see her complete it.\n[Alice]: I'd like to second Bob and Charlie's concerns about Erin's explanation and suggest that we prioritize questioning Erin further, as her lack of a clear alibi and suspicious behavior in the cafeteria could indicate she might be an impostor trying to blend in.\n[Erin]: Bob, to clarify, I was in the cafeteria for a prolonged period attempting the trash task, which experienced a malfunction, delaying its completion, and I only briefly stepped away to check on Dave, who I found dead shortly after.\n[Bob]: I'd like to follow up on Erin's latest response and ask her to provide more specific details about the trash task malfunction, such as what exactly happened and how she attempted to resolve the issue, as this could be a crucial piece of information to verify her story.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to add to Bob's request for more information about the trash task malfunction and ask Erin to provide any additional details about her interactions with Dave before finding him dead.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial to verify Erin's story, and I suggest we ask her to provide more specific details about the malfunction, such as any error messages or issues she encountered, and how she tried to fix it, as this could be a crucial piece of information to verify her story and rule out the possibility that she might be an impostor trying to blend in.\n[Erin]: The malfunctioning trash compactor's paper jam near the shredder mechanism took considerable time to clear;  who else can corroborate the difficulty of that specific type of jam?\n[Bob]: I'd like to point out that Erin's request for corroboration on the trash compactor's paper jam seems like an attempt to deflect attention from her own suspicious behavior, and I'd like to refocus the discussion on verifying her alibi and asking Charlie and Alice if they saw her in the cafeteria during the time she claims to have been working on the trash task.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to address Erin's request for corroboration on the trash compactor's paper jam and state that I did see her struggling with the trash task, but I didn't see her actually clear the jam or complete the task, which raises more questions about her alibi and makes me lean towards believing that she might be trying to fake a task to blend in.\n[Alice]: I still believe that Erin's story raises more red flags than green lights, and I'd like to ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her interaction with Dave, including the exact time she claims to have found him dead and what she did immediately after, as this could help us understand if she's telling the truth or just concocting an alibi.\n[Erin]: Let's move on from the trash compactor; who else saw Dave before his death, and can we establish a more precise timeline of events leading up to his discovery?\n[Bob]: I'd like to address Erin's latest message and point out that her attempt to shift the discussion away from her own alibi and onto the timeline of events leading up to Dave's death seems suspicious, and I think we should continue to press her for more information about her own actions during that time.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Bob that Erin's attempt to shift the discussion away from her own alibi is suspicious, and I think we should continue to press her for more information about her own actions during that time, especially considering that she was one of the last people to see Dave alive and her lack of a clear alibi makes her a prime suspect in my book.\n[Alice]: I agree with Bob and Charlie that Erin's attempt to shift the discussion away from her own alibi is suspicious, and I think we should continue to press her for more information about her own actions during that time, as her lack of a clear

let's hear from those who saw Dave *before* I did to create a more complete timeline.\n[Bob]: I'd like to request that Charlie and Alice confirm whether they saw Erin in the cafeteria during the time she claims to have been working on the trash task, as this could help clarify her alibi and determine whether she's telling the truth about not eliminating Dave.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to verify my own observations regarding Erin's presence in the cafeteria: I saw Erin struggling with the trash task, but I didn't see her actually clear the jam or complete the task.\n", "\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nHere are my discussion points:\n\n- I'd like to reiterate that Erin's story still raises more red flags than green lights, and I think it's crucial that we continue to press her for more information about her actions during the time Dave was killed.\n- I agree with Bob that Erin's request for corroboration on the trash compactor's paper jam seems like an attempt to deflect attention from her own suspicious behavior, and I think we should continue to focus on verifying her alibi.\n- I'd like to respond to Erin's latest message and point out that asking others to share their observations of Dave before his death is a clever way to shift the attention away from her own suspicious behavior, but it doesn't change the fact that she was one of the last people to see Dave alive and her lack of a clear alibi makes her a prime suspect.\n- I'd like to answer Bob's request and confirm that I did see Erin in the cafeteria during the time she claims to have been working on the trash task, but I didn't see her actually clear the jam or complete the task, which raises more questions about her alibi.\n- I think it's essential that we establish a clear timeline of events leading up to Dave's discovery, but we should also prioritize verifying Erin's alibi and determining whether she's telling the truth about not eliminating Dave.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was in the cafeteria the whole time pretending to empty the trash, and I saw Dave, Charlie, and Alice all working on tasks \u2013 Bob, where were you?\n[Bob]: I think Erin's explanation about pretending to empty the trash is suspicious, and I'd like to know more about what she was actually doing during that time, especially since I saw her just standing there without actually emptying the trash.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Bob that Erin's explanation is suspicious, and I think we should press her for more information about what she was doing during that time, especially since I saw her initially start the task but didn't see her complete it.\n[Alice]: I'd like to second Bob and Charlie's concerns about Erin's explanation and suggest that we prioritize questioning Erin further, as her lack of a clear alibi and suspicious behavior in the cafeteria could indicate she might be an impostor trying to blend in.\n[Erin]: Bob, to clarify, I was in the cafeteria for a prolonged period attempting the trash task, which experienced a malfunction, delaying its completion, and I only briefly stepped away to check on Dave, who I found dead shortly after.\n[Bob]: I'd like to follow up on Erin's latest response and ask her to provide more specific details about the trash task malfunction, such as what exactly happened and how she attempted to resolve the issue, as this could be a crucial piece of information to verify her story.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to add to Bob's request for more information about the trash task malfunction and ask Erin to provide any additional details about her interactions with Dave before finding him dead.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial to verify Erin's story, and I suggest we ask her to provide more specific details about the malfunction, such as any error messages or issues she encountered, and how she tried to fix it, as this could be a crucial piece of information to verify her story and rule out the possibility that she might be an impostor trying to blend in.\n[Erin]: The malfunctioning trash compactor's paper jam near the shredder mechanism took considerable time to clear;
