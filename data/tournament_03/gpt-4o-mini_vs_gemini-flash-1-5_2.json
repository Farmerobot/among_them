It\u2019s crucial for us to establish timelines to figure out who was where.\n- Charlie, you mentioned being alone in Medbay; did you see anyone else go in or out of there?

We should focus on players who can provide more substantial alibis.\n- Charlie seems to have a solid alibi from Medbay, but we should still verify if anyone else can confirm their presence there during that time to strengthen the timeline.\n- Since I was seen starting the coffee machine, it might be beneficial to ask if anyone else can verify their actions in the cafeteria to further establish my credibility. \n- I suggest we consider calling an emergency meeting soon to discuss Bob\u2019s actions and potentially vote if we can\u2019t get more clarity on his task completion.", "I think it's crucial we keep the spotlight on Bob and his Admin tasks, as without solid verification of his actions there, we could be overlooking a key impostor; let's gather more information before considering any votes.", "- I think we should also consider Alice's actions; she was fixing wiring in the cafeteria, but did anyone see her complete that task?\n- Erin, since you were briefly in the cafeteria, could you clarify if you noticed anyone suspicious while you were there? This might help us narrow down our suspects.\n- Charlie, while you were in Medbay, did you see anyone come in or out? If we can cross-reference timelines, it might help us identify inconsistencies.\n- Let's not forget that Bob's return to the cafeteria could be a key moment; if we can confirm his tasks in Admin, it would give us a clearer picture of his alibi.", "I think we should also consider Alice's actions; she was fixing wiring in the cafeteria, but did anyone see her complete that task?", "- I think we should keep the focus on Bob and his Admin tasks, as he hasn\u2019t provided any substantial proof of completing them; this could be a critical point in identifying the impostor.\n- Erin, since you were briefly in the cafeteria, can you clarify how long you actually observed Alice fixing wiring?
