if she was completing a scan, that would make her a potential target for Bob, who seems eager to shift the focus away from himself.\n- Bob's insistence on comparing timelines could indeed be a distraction tactic; he might be trying to confuse us about his whereabouts after leaving Medbay.\n- It's interesting that Bob claims to have completed a verifiable task, but we need to remember that both impostors can fake tasks; we should be cautious about taking his word for it without evidence.\n- Since Bob has moved away from Medbay, it might be worth discussing where everyone else was while he was there; did anyone see him complete the scan?\n- I suggest we keep the pressure on Bob;

we should focus on why he was so quick to distance himself to Upper Engine right after being with Erin.\n[Charlie]: While reconstructing the timeline is crucial, Bob's rapid movement to Upper Engine after being with Erin in Medbay, without corroborating witnesses, remains a key point of concern that warrants further scrutiny.\n[Bob]: I completed the Medbay scan, a verifiable task, before moving to Upper Engine, and I propose we compare everyone's timelines to eliminate any inconsistencies rather than focusing solely on my movements.\n[Alice]: I believe we should not let Bob's claims of completing a verifiable task overshadow the fact that both impostors can fake tasks, and his quick transition to Upper Engine without witnesses only heightens the need for scrutiny on his actions.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Let's focus on independently verifying Bob's Medbay scan claim and comparing that timeline to others' accounts before accepting his explanation for his rapid movement to Upper Engine.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it quite odd that both Erin and Bob were in Medbay for an extended period with no one else around, and since Bob just moved to Upper Engine, it raises suspicion about whether he was really doing tasks or if he had a chance to eliminate someone.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Alice;
