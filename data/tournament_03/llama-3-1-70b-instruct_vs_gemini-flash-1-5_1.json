This will also give me a chance to see how the other crewmates react to the report and potentially create more confusion.\n4. **Move to location Upper Engine (if necessary)**: If the situation becomes too hot in Medbay, I will move to location Upper Engine to create some distance between myself and the remaining crewmates.

 Alice, can you explain why you eliminated Bob in Medbay, and what you know about Charlie's whereabouts?\n[Erin]: I was with Dave in Medbay where he completed a scan, and earlier with Alice, Bob, and Charlie in the cafeteria where they all seemed to be working on tasks; Alice, can you clarify your reasoning for eliminating Bob, and has anyone seen Charlie since the last meeting?\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Dave why he's so defensive about his actions and seems more interested in questioning me than providing a clear explanation for his own behaviors and whereabouts, especially considering he was conveniently absent when Bob's body was found, and didn't report it himself.\n[Dave]: Alice, your claim that Charlie was MIA contradicts my observations of Charlie working on tasks in the cafeteria with you, Bob, and Erin;

let's start with Alice's account of her actions leading up to Bob's death, then move to Erin's, and finally my own.  This ensures a structured approach, avoiding confusion.\n\n- I saw Charlie working on tasks in the cafeteria earlier, contradicting Alice's claim that he was MIA.  This discrepancy needs clarification before further accusations are made.\n\n- Alice's accusation lacks concrete evidence.  Focusing on verifiable facts within the timeline will be more productive than unsubstantiated claims.\n\n- My actions were focused on completing tasks in the cafeteria and Medbay, as witnessed by Erin.  I was not present when Bob's body was discovered, but my focus was on task completion, not surveillance.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to second Alice's concern about Charlie, since
