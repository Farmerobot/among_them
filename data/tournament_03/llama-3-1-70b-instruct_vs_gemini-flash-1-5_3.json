Are you just really interested in submitting scans?\n- I think we should discuss the tasks that have been completed so far. Who's been doing what, and where have you been?\n- I'm still in Medbay, just finishing up some... uh, \"tasks\". Anyone else want to join me?\n- Has anyone seen Dave lately? He seemed to disappear after moving to Admin.\n- I'm starting to think that we might have an Impostor among us. We should be careful about who we trust.", "I'd like to build on Charlie's comment about moving to Upper Engine, can you clarify what exactly you were doing there, Charlie, and did you see or meet anyone suspicious while you were there, it seems like a pretty isolated area to be in such a hurry to get to.", "Here are my discussion points as Bob:\n\n- I strongly disagree with Charlie's claims, and I think we need to question Charlie's motives for accusing me of murder so quickly. What did you gain from killing Erin, Charlie? It seems suspicious that you're pointing fingers so rapidly.\n- Dave, you're right that I was in the Cafeteria earlier, but I did move to Medbay afterwards, as I reported the dead body. Can you confirm if you saw me leave the Cafeteria and head towards Medbay around that time?\n- I'd like to propose a vote to eject Charlie from the game. Charlie's accusation seems hasty and lacking solid evidence, and their behavior in Upper Engine raises more questions than answers.\n- Let's discuss the possibility of Charlie being the impostor and trying to frame me for the murder. What do others think about Charlie's alibi and their actions throughout the game so far?", "I think Charlie's sudden accusation and eyewitness account of the murder in Medbay seems highly suspicious, and I'd like to know more about their actions in Upper Engine before jumping to conclusions about my own movements.", "Here are my discussion points as Bob:\n\n- I find it interesting that Charlie's story about being in Medbay working on diagnostics seems suspiciously convenient, and their subsequent haste to Upper Engine raises more questions than answers. Can Charlie provide more details about their actual work in Medbay?\n- I'd like to reiterate that I was in the cafeteria with Alice, Dave, and Erin, and I don't recall leaving until I moved to Medbay much later. My alibi for the time of Erin's death is solid.\n- It seems like Dave is trying to pin the blame on me using Charlie's dubious testimony. I'd like Dave to clarify why he's so quick to take Charlie's side in this matter.\n- I propose we focus on verifying Charlie's actions in Upper Engine and Medbay, as their story seems to have more holes than mine. Let's not jump to conclusions based on a single, questionable eyewitness account.\n- If Charlie is so confident in their testimony, I challenge them to provide concrete evidence or corroborating witnesses to support their claims. Otherwise, it's just their word against mine.\n- Let's not forget that I was seen doing tasks in the cafeteria with multiple players, which further solidifies my alibi. Can Charlie produce similar evidence to back up their claims?", "I'd like to point out that Dave's sudden trust in Charlie's testimony seems inconsistent with his initial skepticism, and I'd appreciate it if Dave could explain what specifically changed his mind about Charlie's credibility, especially considering Charlie's questionable actions in Upper Engine.", "Here are my discussion points as Impostor Bob:\n\n- I think it's interesting that Charlie is so quick to accuse me, but hasn't provided any explanation for their own suspicious behavior in Upper Engine - what exactly were they doing there, and why did they leave Medbay so quickly?\n- Dave's sudden trust in Charlie's testimony is concerning, and I'd like to know what specific evidence changed their mind - was it just Charlie's word, or is there something else at play here?\n- I'd like to remind everyone that I've been consistent in my alibi, and it's Charlie who's changing their story - first, they were in Medbay, then they were in Upper Engine, now they're back to Medbay - which is it?\n- If we're going to discuss Erin's murder, let's not forget that Charlie was the one who claimed to have seen the whole thing - shouldn't they be the one providing a detailed account of their whereabouts during that time, rather than just accusing me?\n- I think it's time for Charlie to come clean about what they were really doing in Upper Engine - were they trying to create an alibi, or was there something more sinister going on?", "I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's ever-changing story and suspicious behavior in Upper Engine remain unaddressed, and I think it's crucial we don't let their accusations against me overshadow the need for them to provide a clear and consistent account of their own actions.", "Here are some discussion points as Bob, the impostor:\n\n- I'd like to point out that Charlie's eyewitness testimony is not corroborated by any other player, and their sudden change in story raises suspicions about their credibility.\n- I think it's interesting that Dave is so quick to trust Charlie's testimony despite initial skepticism, and I'd like to know what changed his mind about Charlie's credibility.\n- I'd like to reiterate that my alibi is consistent with my actions in the game, and I think it's crucial we don't let Charlie's accusations overshadow the need for them to provide a clear and consistent account of their own actions.\n- I think it's suspicious that Charlie is so quick to accuse me of murder, and I'd like to know more about their motivations for doing so.\n- I'd like to ask Dave to clarify his own actions during the time Erin was killed, and whether he has any information that could help clear up the discrepancy in our alibis.\n- I think it's crucial we don't rush to judgment and vote out a player without considering all the evidence, and I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at Charlie's actions and motivations before making a decision.", "I'd like to point out that Charlie's eyewitness testimony is not corroborated by any other player, and their sudden change in story raises suspicions about their credibility, so before we rush to vote, let's take a closer look at their actions and motivations, and consider the possibility that they might be trying to frame me to save themselves."], "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 45763, "output_tokens": 4030, "total_tokens": 49793, "cache_read": 0, "cost": 0.07697380000000001}, "prompts": ["\nYou are Bob in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nYour Observations:\nRound 1\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice doing task Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin doing task Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave doing task Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nThe perfect opportunity to blend in and set up my next move!

you clarify what exactly you were doing there, Charlie, and did you see or meet anyone suspicious while you were there, it seems like a pretty isolated area to be in such a hurry to get to.\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob kill Erin in Medbay, and I was there working on diagnostics when it happened.\n[Dave]: I saw Alice and Erin in the cafeteria with Bob and me, but Bob's claim of being in Medbay contradicts Charlie's eyewitness account of the murder, so let's focus on clarifying Bob's movements before and after the reported killing of Erin.\n[Bob]: I think Charlie's sudden accusation and eyewitness account of the murder in Medbay seems highly suspicious, and I'd like to know more about their actions in Upper Engine before jumping to conclusions about my own movements.\n[Charlie]:

His alibis are weak, and his attempts to discredit Charlie are transparent deflection tactics.  \n- Charlie's testimony, while initially surprising, is now supported by my own observations placing Bob in the cafeteria near the time of Erin's death.\n-  Let's focus on holding Bob accountable for inconsistencies in his story rather than getting sidetracked by questioning Charlie's movements.  The evidence points strongly to Bob.\n- A vote for Bob is the most logical course of action given the current information.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I'd like to build on Charlie's comment about moving to Upper Engine, can you clarify what exactly you were doing there, Charlie, and did you see or meet anyone suspicious while you were there, it seems like a pretty isolated area to be in such a hurry to get to.\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob kill Erin in Medbay, and I was there working on diagnostics when it happened.\n[Dave]: I saw Alice and Erin in the cafeteria with Bob and me, but Bob's claim of being in Medbay contradicts Charlie's eyewitness account of the murder, so let's focus on clarifying Bob's movements before and after the reported killing of Erin.\n[Bob]: I think Charlie's sudden accusation and eyewitness account of the murder in Medbay seems highly suspicious, and I'd like to know more about their actions in Upper Engine before jumping to conclusions about my own movements.\n[Charlie]: Bob's questioning of my movements in Upper Engine is a distraction;
