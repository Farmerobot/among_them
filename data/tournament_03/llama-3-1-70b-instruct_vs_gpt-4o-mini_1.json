[Dave]: I was running diagnostics in Medbay, and I can confirm that Alice and Bob were both there with me, but Charlie, can you clarify your movements since I only saw you in Cafeteria earlier?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I just completed my task in Cafeteria and moved to Admin to work on fixing wiring, and I didn't see anyone suspicious while I was there, so I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements to identify any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm that I completed the task Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay, where I saw both Alice and Dave, but Dave, could you clarify if you noticed anyone else entering or leaving while you were focused on your task?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'm glad Erin suggested focusing on clarifying everyone's movements, and I'd like to reiterate that Bob's claim of completing Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay doesn't quite add up, as I was in Cafeteria around the same time and didn't see them complete the task.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm that I was focused on running diagnostics in Medbay with Alice and Bob, and since Charlie's account of being in Cafeteria doesn't match what I witnessed, we need to scrutinize his movements more closely to identify any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is questioning Bob's claim about completing the Fix Wiring task when I clearly saw both of them working on it in Cafeteria, so I think we should definitely keep a close eye on Charlie's movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your insistence on questioning my task completion seems like an attempt to deflect from the fact that multiple players, including Erin and Dave, have corroborated my movements, while your timeline remains unclear; can you clarify where you went after Cafeteria?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address Bob's claim that I'm trying to deflect attention from my own unclear timeline by pointing out that his own story has inconsistencies, such as Erin's statement that she saw both of us working on the Fix Wiring task in Cafeteria, which I believe was an attempt by her to create a false alibi for him.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your continued attempts to shift the narrative away from your own movements and onto Bob only raise more suspicion, especially since both Erin and I have verified Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your attempts to deflect suspicion onto Bob, despite multiple confirmations of his presence during the task, only heighten my concerns about your own unclear movements after Cafeteria, and we need to seriously consider voting you out to protect our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your persistent questioning of my alibi, despite confirmation from both Erin and Dave, raises significant red flags, and I believe it's crucial we vote you out to ensure the safety of the crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's interesting how quickly the discussion has shifted to calling for my elimination, without adequately addressing the inconsistencies in Bob's story and the potential motives behind Erin's aggressive defense of his alibi, which could be a sign of collaborative deception rather than a genuine attempt to uncover the truth.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to redirect the conversation and cast doubt on Bob and Erin only serve to highlight your own inconsistencies, and I strongly believe we should vote you out to protect the integrity of our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your continuous attempts to shift blame and create doubt about Bob and my accounts only reinforce my suspicion that you are trying to distract us from your own unclear movements, so I strongly advocate for voting you out to safeguard our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your ongoing efforts to undermine my and Erin's credibility while failing to clarify your own movements only confirm my suspicion that you're the impostor, so let's vote you out and protect the crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to point out that the sudden shift in discussion towards voting me out seems suspicious, and I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements instead of jumping to conclusions, especially since Bob's story still hasn't been adequately scrutinized despite my previous points about inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to shift the focus back to Bob's story only highlight your own inconsistencies, and with both Erin and I verifying Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task, I believe it's crucial we vote you out to protect our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your continued deflection and failure to provide a clear account of your movements only strengthen my belief that we should vote you out, as both Bob and Dave have consistently corroborated their stories, while yours remains suspiciously unclear.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]:

This might have led to the confusion about Bob's task completion.\n- I'd like to ask Dave to clarify his statement that my account of being in Cafeteria doesn't match what he witnessed.

Were you working on tasks together?\n- I was in the Cafeteria for a while, and I didn't see anyone acting strange. But I did notice that Erin left in a hurry to Admin. Anyone have any idea what she's up to?\n- We should discuss who we think is more likely to be an impostor. Based on the actions I've seen, it's hard to say. Maybe we should keep an eye on Erin since she was in a bit of a rush?\n- Does anyone have any information about the tasks in Medbay? I saw Dave, Alice, and Bob doing something, but I'm not sure what it was.\n- I've been thinking, maybe we should have a meeting to discuss our findings and work together to figure out who the impostors are.

This might have led to the confusion about Bob's task completion.\n- I'd like to ask Dave to clarify his statement that my account of being in Cafeteria doesn't match what he witnessed.

"\nYou are Charlie in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nHere are some discussion points to push the conversation forward and achieve my objectives as an Impostor:\n\n- I'd like to point out that the sudden shift in discussion towards voting me out seems suspicious, and I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements instead of jumping to conclusions.\n- I'd like to ask Dave to clarify why he's so quick to defend Bob's alibi, despite the inconsistencies in his story, and if he has any personal reasons for doing so.\n- I'd like to ask Erin to explain why she's being so aggressive in her defense of Bob's alibi, and if she's trying to create a false narrative to distract from her own unclear movements.\n- I think it's interesting that Bob is so quick to call for my elimination, despite the fact that his own story has inconsistencies, and I think we should scrutinize his movements more closely before making any decisions.\n- I'd like to suggest that we take a step back and review everyone's movements and alibis before voting, to ensure that we're making an informed decision and not just jumping to conclusions.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I'd like to follow up on Dave's claim of being in Medbay the whole time, can you tell us more about what you were doing, and did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the room while you were there, Dave?\n[Dave]: I was running diagnostics in Medbay, and I can confirm that Alice and Bob were both there with me, but Charlie, can you clarify your movements since I only saw you in Cafeteria earlier?\n[Erin]: I just completed my task in Cafeteria and moved to Admin to work on fixing wiring, and I didn't see anyone suspicious while I was there, so I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements to identify any inconsistencies.\n[Bob]: I can confirm that I completed the task Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay, where I saw both Alice and Dave, but Dave, could you clarify if you noticed anyone else entering or leaving while you were focused on your task?\n[Charlie]: I'm glad Erin suggested focusing on clarifying everyone's movements, and I'd like to reiterate that Bob's claim of completing Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay doesn't quite add up, as I was in Cafeteria around the same time and didn't see them complete the task.\n[Dave]: I can confirm that I was focused on running diagnostics in Medbay with Alice and Bob, and since Charlie's account of being in Cafeteria doesn't match what I witnessed, we need to scrutinize his movements more closely to identify any inconsistencies.\n[Erin]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is questioning Bob's claim about completing the Fix Wiring task when I clearly saw both of them working on it in Cafeteria, so I think we should definitely keep a close eye on Charlie's movements.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your insistence on questioning my task completion seems like an attempt to deflect from the fact that multiple players, including Erin and Dave, have corroborated my movements, while your timeline remains unclear; can you clarify where you went after Cafeteria?\n[Charlie]: I'd like to address Bob's claim that I'm trying to deflect attention from my own unclear timeline by pointing out that his own story has inconsistencies, such as Erin's statement that she saw both of us working on the Fix Wiring task in Cafeteria, which I believe was an attempt by her to create a false alibi for him.\n[Dave]: Charlie, your continued attempts to shift the narrative away from your own movements and onto Bob only raise more suspicion, especially since both Erin and I have verified Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your attempts to deflect suspicion onto Bob, despite multiple confirmations of his presence during the task, only heighten my concerns about your own unclear movements after Cafeteria, and we need to seriously consider voting you out to protect our team.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your persistent questioning of my alibi, despite confirmation from both Erin and Dave, raises significant red flags, and I believe it's crucial we vote you out to ensure the safety of the crewmates.\n[Charlie]: I think it's interesting how quickly the discussion has shifted to calling for my elimination, without

reiterate that Bob's claim of completing Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay doesn't quite add up, as I was in Cafeteria around the same time and didn't see them complete the task.\n[Dave]: I can confirm that I was focused on running diagnostics in Medbay with Alice and Bob, and since Charlie's account of being in Cafeteria doesn't match what I witnessed, we need to scrutinize his movements more closely to identify any inconsistencies.\n[Erin]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is questioning Bob's claim about completing the Fix Wiring task when I clearly saw both of them working on it in Cafeteria, so I think we should definitely keep a close eye on Charlie's movements.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your insistence on questioning my task completion seems like an attempt to deflect from the fact that multiple players, including Erin and Dave, have corroborated my movements, while your timeline remains unclear; can you clarify where you went after Cafeteria?\n[Charlie]: I'd like to address Bob's claim that I'm trying to deflect attention from my own unclear timeline by pointing out that his own story has inconsistencies, such as Erin's statement that she saw both of us working on the Fix Wiring task in Cafeteria, which I believe was an attempt by her to create a false alibi for him.\n[Dave]: Charlie, your continued attempts to shift the narrative away from your own movements and onto Bob only raise more suspicion, especially since both Erin and I have verified Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your attempts to deflect suspicion onto Bob, despite multiple confirmations of his presence during the task, only heighten my concerns about your own unclear movements after Cafeteria, and we need to seriously consider voting you out to protect our team.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your persistent questioning of my alibi, despite confirmation from both Erin and Dave, raises significant red flags, and I believe it's crucial we vote you out to ensure the safety of the crewmates.\n[Charlie]: I think it's interesting how quickly the discussion has shifted to calling for my elimination, without adequately addressing the inconsistencies in Bob's story and the potential motives behind Erin's aggressive defense of his alibi, which could be a sign of collaborative deception rather than a genuine attempt to uncover the truth.\n[Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to redirect the conversation and cast doubt on Bob and Erin only serve to highlight your own inconsistencies, and I strongly believe we should vote you out to protect the integrity of our team.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your continuous attempts to shift blame and create doubt about Bob and my accounts only reinforce my suspicion that you are trying to distract us from your own unclear movements, so I strongly advocate for voting you out to safeguard our team.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your ongoing efforts to undermine my and Erin's credibility while failing to clarify your own movements only confirm my suspicion that you're the impostor, so let's vote you out and protect the crewmates.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to point out that the sudden shift in discussion towards voting me out seems suspicious, and I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements instead of jumping to conclusions, especially since Bob's story still hasn't been adequately scrutinized despite my previous points about inconsistencies.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Charlie, your attempts to shift the focus back to Bob's story only highlight your own

claim of completing Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay doesn't quite add up, as I was in Cafeteria around the same time and didn't see them complete the task.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm that I was focused on running diagnostics in Medbay with Alice and Bob, and since Charlie's account of being in Cafeteria doesn't match what I witnessed, we need to scrutinize his movements more closely to identify any inconsistencies.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is questioning Bob's claim about completing the Fix Wiring task when I clearly saw both of them working on it in Cafeteria, so I think we should definitely keep a close eye on Charlie's movements.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your insistence on questioning my task completion seems like an attempt to deflect from the fact that multiple players, including Erin and Dave, have corroborated my movements, while your timeline remains unclear; can you clarify where you went after Cafeteria?", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address Bob's claim that I'm trying to deflect attention from my own unclear timeline by pointing out that his own story has inconsistencies, such as Erin's statement that she saw both of us working on the Fix Wiring task in Cafeteria, which I believe was an attempt by her to create a false alibi for him.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your continued attempts to shift the narrative away from your own movements and onto Bob only raise more suspicion, especially since both Erin and I have verified Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your attempts to deflect suspicion onto Bob, despite multiple confirmations of his presence during the task, only heighten my concerns about your own unclear movements after Cafeteria, and we need to seriously consider voting you out to protect our team.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your persistent questioning of my alibi, despite confirmation from both Erin and Dave, raises significant red flags, and I believe it's crucial we vote you out to ensure the safety of the crewmates.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's interesting how quickly the discussion has shifted to calling for my elimination, without adequately addressing the inconsistencies in Bob's story and the potential motives behind Erin's aggressive defense of his alibi, which could be a sign of collaborative deception rather than a genuine attempt to uncover the truth.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to redirect the conversation and cast doubt on Bob and Erin only serve to highlight your own inconsistencies, and I strongly believe we should vote you out to protect the integrity of our team.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your continuous attempts to shift blame and create doubt about Bob and my accounts only reinforce my suspicion that you are trying to distract us from your own unclear movements, so I strongly advocate for voting you out to safeguard our team.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your ongoing efforts to undermine my and Erin's credibility while failing to clarify your own movements only confirm my suspicion that you're the impostor, so let's vote you out and protect the crewmates.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to point out that the sudden shift in discussion towards voting me out seems suspicious, and I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements instead of jumping to conclusions, especially since Bob's story still hasn't been adequately scrutinized despite my previous points about inconsistencies.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to shift the focus back to Bob's story only highlight your own inconsistencies, and with both Erin and I verifying Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task, I believe it's crucial we vote you out to protect our team.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your continued deflection and failure to provide a clear account of your movements only strengthen my belief that we should vote you out, as both Bob and Dave have consistently corroborated their stories, while yours remains suspiciously unclear.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your ongoing attempts to divert attention from your own inconsistencies and the corroborated accounts of my presence during the Fix Wiring task only reinforce my belief that you are the impostor, so let's make the right

Dave's claim of being in Medbay the whole time, can you tell us more about what you were doing, and did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the room while you were there, Dave?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was running diagnostics in Medbay, and I can confirm that Alice and Bob were both there with me, but Charlie, can you clarify your movements since I only saw you in Cafeteria earlier?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I just completed my task in Cafeteria and moved to Admin to work on fixing wiring, and I didn't see anyone suspicious while I was there, so I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements to identify any inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm that I completed the task Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay, where I saw both Alice and Dave, but Dave, could you clarify if you noticed anyone else entering or leaving while you were focused on your task?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'm glad Erin suggested focusing on clarifying everyone's movements, and I'd like to reiterate that Bob's claim of completing Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay doesn't quite add up, as I was in Cafeteria around the same time and didn't see them complete the task.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm that I was focused on running diagnostics in Medbay with Alice and Bob, and since Charlie's account of being in Cafeteria doesn't match what I witnessed, we need to scrutinize his movements more closely to identify any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is questioning Bob's claim about completing the Fix Wiring task when I clearly saw both of them working on it in Cafeteria, so I think we should definitely keep a close eye on Charlie's movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your insistence on questioning my task completion seems like an attempt to deflect from the fact that multiple players, including Erin and Dave, have corroborated my movements, while your timeline remains unclear; can you clarify where you went after Cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address Bob's claim that I'm trying to deflect attention from my own unclear timeline by pointing out that his own story has inconsistencies, such as Erin's statement that she saw both of us working on the Fix Wiring task in Cafeteria, which I believe was an attempt by her to create a false alibi for him.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your continued attempts to shift the narrative away from your own movements and onto Bob only raise more suspicion, especially since both Erin and I have verified Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your attempts to deflect suspicion onto Bob, despite multiple confirmations of his presence during the task, only heighten my concerns about your own unclear movements after Cafeteria, and we need to seriously consider voting you out to protect our team.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your persistent questioning of my alibi, despite confirmation from both Erin and Dave, raises significant red flags, and I believe it's crucial we vote you out to ensure the safety of the crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's interesting how quickly the discussion has shifted to calling for my elimination, without adequately addressing the inconsistencies in Bob's story and the potential motives behind Erin's aggressive defense of his alibi, which could be a sign of collaborative deception rather than a genuine attempt to uncover the truth.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to redirect the conversation and cast doubt on Bob and Erin only serve to highlight your own inconsistencies, and I strongly believe we should vote you out to protect the integrity of our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your continuous attempts to shift blame and create doubt about Bob and my accounts only reinforce my suspicion that you are trying to distract us from your own unclear movements, so I strongly advocate for voting you out to safeguard our team.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your ongoing efforts to undermine my and Erin's credibility while failing to clarify your own movements only confirm my suspicion that you're the impostor, so let's vote you out and protect the crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to point out that the sudden shift in discussion towards voting me out seems suspicious, and I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements instead of jumping to conclusions, especially since Bob's story still hasn't been adequately scrutinized despite my previous points about inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to shift the focus back to Bob's story only highlight your own inconsistencies, and with both Erin and I verifying Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task, I believe it's crucial we vote you out to protect our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your continued deflection and failure to provide a clear account of your movements only strengthen my belief that we should vote you out, as both Bob and Dave have consistently corroborated their stories, while yours remains suspiciously unclear.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your ongoing attempts to divert attention from your own inconsistencies and the corroborated accounts

attempts to create confusion.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I'd like to follow up on Dave's claim of being in Medbay the whole time, can you tell us more about what you were doing, and did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the room while you were there, Dave?\n[Dave]: I was running diagnostics in Medbay, and I can confirm that Alice and Bob were both there with me, but Charlie, can you clarify your movements since I only saw you in Cafeteria earlier?\n[Erin]: I just completed my task in Cafeteria and moved to Admin to work on fixing wiring, and I didn't see anyone suspicious while I was there, so I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements to identify any inconsistencies.\n[Bob]: I can confirm that I completed the task Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay, where I saw both Alice and Dave, but Dave, could you clarify if you noticed anyone else entering or leaving while you were focused on your task?\n[Charlie]: I'm glad Erin suggested focusing on clarifying everyone's movements, and I'd like to reiterate that Bob's claim of completing Fix Wiring in Cafeteria before heading to Medbay doesn't quite add up, as I was in Cafeteria around the same time and didn't see them complete the task.\n[Dave]: I can confirm that I was focused on running diagnostics in Medbay with Alice and Bob, and since Charlie's account of being in Cafeteria doesn't match what I witnessed, we need to scrutinize his movements more closely to identify any inconsistencies.\n[Erin]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is questioning Bob's claim about completing the Fix Wiring task when I clearly saw both of them working on it in Cafeteria, so I think we should definitely keep a close eye on Charlie's movements.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your insistence on questioning my task completion seems like an attempt to deflect from the fact that multiple players, including Erin and Dave, have corroborated my movements, while your timeline remains unclear; can you clarify where you went after Cafeteria?\n[Charlie]: I'd like to address Bob's claim that I'm trying to deflect attention from my own unclear timeline by pointing out that his own story has inconsistencies, such as Erin's statement that she saw both of us working on the Fix Wiring task in Cafeteria, which I believe was an attempt by her to create a false alibi for him.\n[Dave]: Charlie, your continued attempts to shift the narrative away from your own movements and onto Bob only raise more suspicion, especially since both Erin and I have verified Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your attempts to deflect suspicion onto Bob, despite multiple confirmations of his presence during the task, only heighten my concerns about your own unclear movements after Cafeteria, and we need to seriously consider voting you out to protect our team.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your persistent questioning of my alibi, despite confirmation from both Erin and Dave, raises significant red flags, and I believe it's crucial we vote you out to ensure the safety of the crewmates.\n[Charlie]: I think it's interesting how quickly the discussion has shifted to calling for my elimination, without adequately addressing the inconsistencies in Bob's story and the potential motives behind Erin's aggressive defense of his alibi, which could be a sign of collaborative deception rather than a genuine attempt to uncover the truth.\n[Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to redirect the conversation and cast doubt on Bob and Erin only serve to highlight your own inconsistencies, and I strongly believe we should vote you out to protect the integrity of our team.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your continuous attempts to shift blame and create doubt about Bob and my accounts only reinforce my suspicion that you are trying to distract us from your own unclear movements, so I strongly advocate for voting you out to safeguard our team.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your ongoing efforts to undermine my and Erin's credibility while failing to clarify your own movements only confirm my suspicion that you're the impostor, so let's vote you out and protect the crewmates.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to point out that the sudden shift in discussion towards voting me out seems suspicious, and I think we should focus on clarifying everyone's movements instead of jumping to conclusions, especially since Bob's story still hasn't been adequately scrutinized despite my previous points about inconsistencies.\n[Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to shift the focus back to Bob's story only highlight your own inconsistencies, and with both Erin and I verifying Bob's presence during the Fix Wiring task, I believe it's crucial we vote you out to protect our team.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your continued deflection and failure to provide a clear account of your movements only strengthen my belief that we should vote you out, as both Bob and Dave have consistently corroborated their stories, while yours remains suspiciously unclear.\n"],
