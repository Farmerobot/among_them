I think we should still press her for more information.\n- I'd like to ask Charlie and Bob if they noticed anything unusual about Dave's behavior before he died; as someone who was in close proximity to him, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but maybe they did.\n- I agree with Bob that transparency is key;
