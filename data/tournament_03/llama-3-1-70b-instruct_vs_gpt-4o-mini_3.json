Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to confirm what task I've been doing, just to clarify, I was emptying the cafeteria trash, and I saw Erin, Charlie, and Alice doing their tasks in the cafeteria as well.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that I saw Dave doing the task of emptying the cafeteria trash, and since Charlie has been eliminated, we need to focus on who was last seen with him, which includes myself, Dave, and Alice, but I didn't notice anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just completed the \"Submit scan in Medbay\" task, and while I can confirm Erin was doing her scan, we should focus on who was last seen with Charlie, as both Dave and Alice were in the cafeteria with him, which raises some questions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to add that since Bob was just in Medbay, he should be able to confirm whether Alice was indeed doing a task there before she was killed, and if so, did he see anyone suspicious around that time, which could help us piece together the events surrounding her death.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I appreciate everyone's input, but we need to clarify Bob's timeline in Medbay and whether he had a chance to eliminate Alice before reporting the body, as that could be crucial in identifying the impostor among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm that I was in Medbay the entire time with Erin and Alice, and while I didn't see any suspicious activity, we need to scrutinize Erin's and Dave's alibis since they were the last seen with Charlie, which raises valid concerns about their involvement.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to address Bob's concerns about my alibi and suggest that his own actions in Medbay are still unclear, and I think it's interesting that he's trying to shift the focus to me and Erin by pointing out our proximity to Charlie, while his own \"Submit scan in Medbay\" task seems quite rapid, so I'd appreciate it if he could provide more details on how long it took him to complete and if he saw anyone else in the area.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's crucial for Bob to clarify how long he spent on the scan in Medbay, as it could provide insight into whether he had enough time to eliminate Alice before reporting her body, which is a key piece of information we need to determine who the impostor is.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I spent a significant amount of time in Medbay completing my scan, and while I didn't see anyone suspicious, it's odd that both Erin and Dave are trying to deflect attention onto my timeline instead of providing more clarity about their whereabouts with Charlie, which we should investigate further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I note that Bob is being evasive about his exact timeline in Medbay, and his statement about spending a \"significant amount of time\" is quite vague, which makes me question his credibility.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob, your vague statement about spending a \"significant amount of time\" in Medbay raises red flags, and we need you to provide specific details about how long you were there and whether you actually saw Alice before her elimination, as this could help us identify the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand the focus on my timeline, but it's critical to remember that both Erin and Dave were the last seen with Charlie, and their reluctance to discuss their actions raises serious concerns about their potential involvement in his elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that Bob's vagueness about his timeline in Medbay is suspicious, and his attempts to shift the focus to Erin and me are not convincing, so I think it's crucial to investigate Bob's actions in Medbay further, as his \"Submit scan in Medbay\" task seems too rapid, and his statement about spending a \"significant amount of time\" is unconvincing.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob, your continued deflection and lack of specific details about your time in Medbay are concerning, and we need you to clarify exactly how long you were there and whether you actually saw Alice before her elimination to better assess your credibility.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: While I appreciate the focus on my timeline, I believe it\u2019s essential

Since Bob was waiting in Medbay, he could have easily moved to the Cafeteria and back to Medbay without anyone noticing.\n- I'm a bit concerned that Erin is trying to deflect attention from herself by pointing out that Alice and I were last seen with Charlie. While it's true that we were in the same room, I think Erin should answer some questions about her own whereabouts and actions.\n- I think we should also discuss the fact that Alice was doing a task in Medbay right before she was killed.

Points:\nHere are my discussion points as Impostor Dave:\n\n- I'd like to reiterate that Bob's vagueness about his timeline in Medbay is suspicious, and his attempts to shift the focus to Erin and me are not convincing.\n- It's interesting that Bob is trying to scrutinize Erin's and my alibis, but he's not providing any concrete evidence to support his claims.\n- I think it's crucial to investigate Bob's actions in Medbay further, as his \"Submit scan in Medbay\" task seems too rapid, and his statement about spending a \"significant amount of time\" is unconvincing.\n- Erin's concerns about Bob's timeline and potential involvement in Alice's elimination are valid, and we should continue to press him for more information.\n- I'd like to ask Bob to provide a more detailed account of his actions in Medbay, including the exact time he spent on the scan and whether he saw anyone else in the area.\n- It's also worth noting that Bob's defense of his actions is becoming increasingly aggressive, which could be a sign of guilt.\n- I think we should be cautious of Bob's attempts to deflect attention and create suspicion around Erin and me, and instead focus on gathering more information about his actions in Medbay.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I'd like to confirm what task I've been doing, just to clarify, I was emptying the cafeteria trash, and I saw Erin,
