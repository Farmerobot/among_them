concerning, and considering I've confirmed he's still in the Cafeteria, I think it's time we discuss the possibility of calling an emergency meeting to address his suspicious behavior, especially since two tasks are still pending, and we can't afford to have an impostor among us, potentially sabotaging our efforts.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to address the concerns about my silence; I

about 75% done with fixing the wiring, and it should be completed in the next round or so, which I believe aligns with the expected time frame.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I appreciate Bob's update on the wiring task's progress, but I still have some concerns about his lack of attention to the discussion earlier; as crewmates, we need to be able to multitask and stay engaged with the conversation,
