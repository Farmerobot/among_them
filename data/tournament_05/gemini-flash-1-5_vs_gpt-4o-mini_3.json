we need to stay on track and prioritize voting her out.\n- Alice, since you confirmed your innocence with the scan, can you share what you observed during the incident to strengthen our case against Erin?\n- It's crucial that we don't allow Erin's deflections to confuse us; we have strong evidence against her, and voting her out is the safest choice for the remaining crewmates.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was busy emptying the trash in the cafeteria both rounds;

we have clear evidence of her actions, and it's vital we vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Charlie]: I understand the need for scrutiny, Alice, but we have two eyewitness accounts against Erin, and her deflection only serves to divert us from the real issue; we must prioritize voting her out to ensure our safety.\n[Erin]: Dave and Charlie's perfectly synchronized story is far too convenient; let's demand they provide verifiable details about their whereabouts during Bob's death.\n[Alice]: I completed my scan in Medbay, which confirms my innocence, and I urge everyone to share their locations during Bob's death so we can clearly identify any inconsistencies in Dave and Charlie's testimonies.\n[Dave]: Erin's deflection is a clear tactic to divert attention from her actions;
