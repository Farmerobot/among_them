I did not witness the elimination of Mateusz.\n\n- **Witness Testimonies**: Vasyl and Dariusz both claim to have seen Marcin eliminate Mateusz in the Cafeteria. Their testimonies should be prioritized as they provide direct evidence against Marcin.\n\n- **Marcin's Defense**: Marcin is attempting to deflect attention by questioning my alibi and the credibility of Vasyl and Dariusz. This could be a tactic to confuse the discussion.\n\n- **Focus on Evidence**: We need to concentrate on the strong evidence against Marcin, as both Vasyl and Dariusz have corroborated each other's accounts of the incident.\n\n- **Urgency to Vote**: With the evidence presented, we should consider voting for Marcin to prevent further eliminations of crewmates.\n\n### Observations to Share:\n- I saw Mateusz doing a task in the Cafeteria during Round 2.\n- I was alone in Medbay during the elimination and did not see any suspicious activity.\n- Vasyl and Dariusz have both confirmed Marcin's involvement in the elimination of Mateusz.\n\nYour name is Andrii.

This is a critical point that needs to be emphasized in our discussion.\n  \n- **Dariusz's Confirmation**: Dariusz also confirmed that he saw Marcin eliminate Mateusz, which strengthens our case against him.\n\n- **Andrii's Alibi**: Andrii claims he was in Medbay alone during the elimination. While his alibi is unverified, we should focus on the clear evidence against Marcin first.\n\n- **Marcin's Defense**: Marcin is trying to deflect attention by questioning the credibility of Dariusz and me, as well as Andrii's alibi. This could be a tactic to confuse the group.\n\n- **Urgency to Vote**: We need to act quickly to prevent further eliminations. Both Dariusz and I agree that Marcin is the primary suspect and should be voted out.\n\n- **Gathering More Information**: While it's important to gather information, we have strong evidence against Marcin that we cannot ignore.\n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- I saw Marcin eliminate Mateusz in the Cafeteria.\n- Dariusz corroborated my observation.\n- Andrii was in Medbay and did not witness the elimination.\n- Marcin is attempting to shift the focus away from himself by questioning others. \n\nLet's focus our discussion on the evidence against Marcin and make a decision on our vote.\n\nYour name is Vasyl.

Their actions should also be scrutinized.\n  \n- **Question Andrii's Alibi**: Andrii claims to have been alone in Medbay, but he has no witnesses to confirm his task completion. This raises suspicion about his whereabouts.\n\n- **Focus on Task Completion**: We should discuss everyone's task completion to identify who might be avoiding tasks, which could indicate impostor behavior.\n\n- **Dariusz's Confirmation**: Dariusz claims to have seen me eliminate Mateusz, but we need to consider the possibility of misinterpretation or collusion.\n\n- **Vasyl's Consistency**: Vasyl is adamant about my involvement, but we should evaluate if he has any ulterior motives or if he is trying to deflect attention from himself.\n\n- **Gather More Information**: Encourage everyone to share their locations and tasks completed to build a clearer picture of the situation.\n\n- **Emergency Meeting Strategy**: If the discussion continues to focus on me, I may need to call for an emergency meeting to redirect the conversation and gather more information from others. \n\n### Impostor Observations to Share:\n- I was in the Cafeteria during the elimination of Mateusz.\n- I saw Vasyl and Dariusz in the Cafeteria with me.\n- Andrii moved to Medbay and claims to have been working on tasks alone.\n- Dariusz and Vasyl are both accusing me, but their motives should be questioned.\n- We need to focus on gathering more information about everyone's actions and tasks.\n\nYour name is Marcin.

This is a critical point that needs to be emphasized during our discussion.\n  \n- **Andrii's Alibi**: Andrii claims he was alone in Medbay working on tasks after moving from Cafeteria. His alibi is unverified, but it is less suspicious compared to Marcin's actions.\n\n- **Vasyl's Support**: Vasyl has consistently supported my observation regarding Marcin's elimination of Mateusz, reinforcing the credibility of our claims.\n\n- **Marcin's Defense**: Marcin is attempting to deflect attention by questioning our credibility and focusing on Andrii's alibi. We should remain focused on the evidence against him.\n\n- **Urgency to Vote**: We need to act quickly to prevent Marcin from eliminating more crewmates. The evidence against him is strong, and we should prioritize voting him out.\n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- **Round 2**: Saw Mateusz doing a task, Vasyl emptying trash, and Marcin eliminating Mateusz.\n- **Round 3**: Vasyl reported Mateusz's dead body.\n- **Round 4-6**: Continued discussions confirming Marcin's actions and emphasizing the need to vote him out based on witnessed evidence. \n\nLet's ensure we communicate these points clearly to the other players to facilitate a successful vote against Marcin.\n\nYour name is Dariusz.
