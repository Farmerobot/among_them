Here's a GUI development plan using PyQt to visualize your Among Us game state, progressing from a basic JSON display to a richer, more interactive experience.

**Phase 1: Data Visualization Design (High Effort)**

* **Goal:**  Design the optimal way to display the game data, focusing on a clear and intuitive presentation of player information.  The primary goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows for easy monitoring of the game's progress and individual player states.

* **Techniques:**

    * **Tabbed Interface:** Implement a tabbed interface, with one tab dedicated to each player. This allows for a clear separation of player information and prevents visual clutter.  Use `QTabWidget` for this.

    * **Player Status Icons:**  Display a clear icon indicating each player's status (Alive/Dead/Eliminated).  Consider using universally understood symbols (e.g., a green checkmark for Alive, a red X for Dead/Eliminated).  Use `QLabel` with appropriate icons.

    * **Role Icons:** Display an icon representing each player's role (Crewmate/Impostor).  Again, use clear and easily distinguishable icons.  Use `QLabel` with appropriate icons.

    * **Task Progress:** Show the number of completed and remaining tasks for each player.  A progress bar could be a visually effective way to represent this information.  Use `QProgressBar`.

    * **Players in Room:** Display icons or avatars representing the players currently in the same room as the selected player.  This provides a quick visual overview of the player's immediate surroundings.  Use `QLabel` with appropriate icons.

    * **Additional Information:** Consider including other relevant information in each player's tab:
        * **Current Location:** The player's current location on the map.  Use `QLabel`.
        * **Recent Actions:** A log of the player's most recent actions.  Use `QTextEdit` or `QListWidget`.
        * **LLM Responses (Optional):**  If feasible, display the LLM's responses for each player's actions.  This could provide valuable insights into the AI's decision-making process.  Use `QTextEdit`.
        * **Player History:** A summary of the player's actions and events throughout the game.  Use `QTextEdit` or `QListWidget`.
        * **Suspicion Level (Optional):**  If you're tracking suspicion levels, display this information for each player.  This could be a numerical value or a visual representation (e.g., a thermometer).  Use `QLabel` or a custom widget.
        * **Kill Cooldown (Impostors):** For impostors, display their kill cooldown timer.  Use `QLabel`.

    * **Data Structure:**  Ensure your game data is structured in a way that makes it easy to access and display the information needed for each player tab.  Consider using a list of dictionaries or a similar data structure.

    * **Responsive Design:**  Design the interface to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and resolutions.  Use layout managers like `QGridLayout` or `QVBoxLayout` to achieve this.

    * **Accessibility:**  Consider accessibility guidelines when designing the interface.  Use sufficient color contrast, appropriate font sizes, and clear labels.  Use `QApplication.setStyle()` to set a style that adheres to accessibility guidelines.

**Phase 2: Interactive Map (Medium Effort)**

* **Goal:** Create an interactive map visualizing the Among Us game map, displaying player locations, and highlighting selected players.  The map should update dynamically as players move.

* **Techniques:**

    * **Map Representation:** Use a `QLabel` to display an image-based representation of the Among Us map. This provides a visually appealing and familiar context for players.

    * **Player Markers:** Represent each player with a distinct marker on the map, color-coded by role (Crewmate/Impostor) and status (Alive/Dead).  Consider using different marker shapes or sizes to further distinguish players.  Use `QLabel` with appropriate icons or custom widgets.

    * **Dynamic Updates:** Use signals and slots to update the map whenever the game state changes.  Connect signals from your game logic to slots that update the positions of the player markers on the map.

    * **Player Selection and Highlighting:** Implement click-to-select functionality. When a player marker is clicked, that player should be highlighted on the map (e.g., by changing the marker color, size, or adding a border).  Use `QMouseEvent` to detect clicks on the map and update the marker accordingly.

    * **Data Binding:**  Establish a clear mapping between the game state data (player locations) and the map visualization.  This will ensure that updates to the game state automatically trigger corresponding updates on the map.

    * **Layout:**  Consider the map layout.  You might need to adjust marker positions to avoid overlaps, especially in crowded rooms.  Experiment with different marker sizes and positions to optimize readability.  Use layout managers like `QGridLayout` or `QVBoxLayout` to position the map and markers.

    * **Tooltips:**  On hover over a player marker, display a tooltip showing the player's name, role, and status.  This provides additional information without cluttering the map.  Use `QToolTip` to display tooltips.

    * **Room Highlighting (Optional):**  Consider highlighting the room where a significant event (e.g., a kill, a report) occurred.  This can be achieved by changing the color or opacity of the room area on the map.  Use custom widgets or overlay images to highlight rooms.


**Phase 3: Timeline View with QSlider (High Effort)**

* **Goal:** Provide a chronological view of game events using a `QSlider` to select rounds.  Clearly indicate the phase (Action, Discussion, Voting) for each round.

* **Techniques:**

    * **QSlider:** Use `QSlider` to allow users to select a specific round from the game.  The slider's range should be the total number of rounds in the game.

    * **Round Data Display:**  When a round is selected, display the relevant information for that round:
        * **Phase:** Clearly indicate whether the round was an Action, Discussion, or Voting phase.  Use `QLabel`.
        * **Player Actions:** Show the actions taken by each player during that round.  Use `QTextEdit` or `QListWidget`.
        * **Discussion Log (if applicable):** Display the discussion log for that round.  Use `QTextEdit`.
        * **Voting Results (if applicable):** Show the voting results for that round.  Use `QTextEdit` or `QListWidget`.

    * **Data Structure:** Ensure your game data is structured in a way that makes it easy to access the information for each round.  Consider using a list of dictionaries or a similar data structure.

    * **Clear Visual Indicators:** Use distinct visual cues (e.g., different colors, icons, or labels) to differentiate between Action, Discussion, and Voting phases.  Use `QLabel` with appropriate colors or icons.

    * **Error Handling:** Handle cases where the slider is moved beyond the valid range of rounds.  Use signals and slots to ensure the slider stays within the valid range.


**Phase 4: Advanced Features (Advanced Effort)**

* **Goal:** Enhance the GUI with advanced features for analysis and replayability.  The prompts and actions should be displayed in a chat-like format.

* **Techniques:**
    * **Interactive Controls:** Implement controls to step through the game turn by turn, pause, rewind, or fast-forward.  This will allow users to replay the game and analyze decisions at their own pace.  Use `QPushButton` for controls and signals and slots to handle their actions.
    * **Data Export:** Allow users to export the game data (JSON or CSV) for further analysis.  Specifically, provide an option to export the discussion logs and LLM responses separately. This will facilitate detailed analysis of the language used by the agents and the effectiveness of their communication strategies.  Use `QFileDialog` to allow users to select a file for export.
    * **Chat-like Display:** Present the prompts and actions taken by the agents in a chat-like format. This will improve the readability and understanding of the game's progression.  Use `QTextEdit` or a custom widget to display the chat-like format.

This plan provides a structured approach to building your PyQt GUI.  Start with Phase 1, then gradually add features from the subsequent phases based on your time and priorities. Remember to test frequently and iterate on your design.
