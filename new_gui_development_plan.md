## Development Plan: Enhancing the LLMPostor GUI

This plan outlines the development of a comprehensive GUI for the LLMPostor project, focusing on user interaction, game control, and data visualization.

**Phase 1: Core GUI Structure and Game Control**

1. **GUI Framework Selection:**
    - Streamlit
2. **Basic GUI Layout:**
    - Create a main window with distinct sections for:
        - **Turn Control:**
            - Slider to navigate through game turns.
            - "Previous Turn" and "Next Turn" buttons for sequential navigation.
        - **Game Control:**
            - "Resume" and "Stop" buttons to control game execution.
            - "Save State" functionality to save the current game state to a separate file.
        - **Player Action Selection:**
            - Section for manual action selection, allowing users to choose actions for a specific player.
        - **Save Game State:**
            - Implement functionality to save the game state to a separate file.

**Phase 2: Discussion and Voting Visualization**

1. **Discussion Window:**
    - Create a separate window to display the discussion phase of the game.
    - Implement a chat-like interface to visualize player messages:
        - Display messages chronologically.
        - Different player colors for easy identification.
2. **Voting Results Visualization:**
    - Create a section within the Discussion window to display voting results.
    - Visualize voting results using a clear and intuitive representation:
        - Bar chart: Show the number of votes for each player.

**Phase 3: Cost Estimation and LLM Interaction Visualization**

1. **Cost Estimation:**
    - Display estimated game costs at the top of the GUI.
    - Include token usage and cost for each player:
        - Display this information in a clear and concise format.
2. **LLM Interaction Visualization:**
    - Create a chat window to visualize prompts and responses of player LLMs.
    - Implement a mechanism to collapse prompts by default, allowing users to expand them when needed.
    - Display prompts and responses in a chronological order.

**Phase 4: Refinement and Testing**

1. **GUI Refinement:**
    - Improve the overall aesthetics and user experience of the GUI.
    - Ensure consistent styling and layout across all sections.
    - Use appropriate color schemes, fonts, and spacing to enhance readability and visual appeal.
2. **Testing:**
    - Thoroughly test all GUI functionalities, including:
        - Turn navigation
        - Game control
        - Player action selection
        - Discussion and voting visualization
        - Cost estimation and LLM interaction visualization
    - Conduct usability testing with real users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
3. **Error Handling:**
    - Implement robust error handling mechanisms to prevent unexpected behavior.
    - Handle potential errors gracefully, providing informative messages to the user.
4. **Documentation:**
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the GUI, including:
        - User guide: Explain how to use the GUI, including navigation, controls, and features.
        - Developer documentation: Provide detailed information about the GUI's architecture, code structure, and API.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Scenario Selection:** Allow users to choose from a library of pre-defined scenarios or create their own.
    - Implement a scenario selection menu or dropdown.
    - Provide options to customize scenario parameters (e.g., number of players, impostors, task difficulty).
- **Player Customization:** Allow users to customize player names, avatars, and LLM models.
    - Implement a player customization section.
    - Provide a list of available LLM models and allow users to select their preferred options.
- **Game Speed Control:** Implement a slider or buttons to adjust the speed of the game simulation.
    - Allow users to control the pace of the game based on their preferences.
- **Game History:** Provide a log of past game turns, including player actions, discussion messages, and voting results.
    - Implement a game history section that displays a chronological record of game events.
    - Allow users to filter and search through the game history.
- **Data Export:** Allow users to export game data (e.g., player actions, discussion transcripts, voting results) in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
    - Implement an export functionality that allows users to save game data for further analysis.

This development plan provides a structured approach to building a comprehensive and user-friendly GUI for the LLMPostor project. By following these phases and considering the additional features and extensions, you can create a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing the persuasive abilities of LLMs in a game-like environment.
