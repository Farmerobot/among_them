## Development Plan: Enhancing the LLMPostor GUI

This plan outlines the development of a comprehensive GUI for the LLMPostor project, focusing on user interaction, game control, and data visualization.


**Phase 2: Discussion and Voting Visualization**

1. **Voting Results Visualization:**
    - Create a section within the Discussion window to display voting results.
    - Visualize voting results using a clear and intuitive representation:
        - Bar chart: Show the number of votes for each player.


**Additional Considerations:**

- **Scenario Selection:** Allow users to choose from a library of pre-defined scenarios or create their own.
    - Implement a scenario selection menu or dropdown.
    - Provide options to customize scenario parameters (e.g., number of players, impostors, task difficulty).
- **Player Customization:** Allow users to customize player LLM models.
    - Provide a list of available LLM models and allow users to select their preferred options.
- **Data Export:** Allow users to export game state.
    - Implement an export functionality that allows users to save game data for further analysis.

This development plan provides a structured approach to building a comprehensive and user-friendly GUI for the LLMPostor project. By following these phases and considering the additional features and extensions, you can create a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing the persuasive abilities of LLMs in a game-like environment.
