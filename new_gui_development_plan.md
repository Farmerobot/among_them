## Development Plan: Enhancing the LLMPostor GUI

This plan outlines the development of a comprehensive GUI for the LLMPostor project, focusing on user interaction, game control, and data visualization.


**Phase 2: Discussion and Voting Visualization**

1. **Voting Results Visualization:**
    - Create a section within the Discussion window to display voting results.
    - Visualize voting results using a clear and intuitive representation:
        - Bar chart: Show the number of votes for each player.

**Phase 3: LLM Interaction Visualization**

1. **LLM Interaction Visualization:**
    - Create a chat window to visualize prompts and responses of player LLMs.
    - Implement a mechanism to collapse prompts by default, allowing users to expand them when needed.
    - Display prompts and responses in a chronological order.


**Additional Considerations:**

- **Scenario Selection:** Allow users to choose from a library of pre-defined scenarios or create their own.
    - Implement a scenario selection menu or dropdown.
    - Provide options to customize scenario parameters (e.g., number of players, impostors, task difficulty).
- **Player Customization:** Allow users to customize player names, avatars, and LLM models.
    - Implement a player customization section.
    - Provide a list of available LLM models and allow users to select their preferred options.
- **Game History:** Provide a log of past game turns, including player actions, discussion messages, and voting results.
    - Implement a game history section that displays a chronological record of game events.
    - Allow users to filter and search through the game history.
- **Data Export:** Allow users to export game data (e.g., player actions, discussion transcripts, voting results) in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
    - Implement an export functionality that allows users to save game data for further analysis.

This development plan provides a structured approach to building a comprehensive and user-friendly GUI for the LLMPostor project. By following these phases and considering the additional features and extensions, you can create a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing the persuasive abilities of LLMs in a game-like environment. 


**Phase ????**
        - **Turn Control:**
            - Slider to navigate through game turns.
            - "Previous Turn" and "Next Turn" buttons for sequential navigation.
        - **Game Control:**
            - "Resume" and "Stop" buttons to control game execution.
            - "Save State" functionality to save the current game state to a separate file.
        - **Player Action Selection:**
            - Section for manual action selection, allowing users to choose actions for a specific player.
