GAME_CONTEXT = """
This is a text-based social deduction game where players explore a virtual house while trying to complete objectives. The game has two phases:
1. Action Phase: Players can move between rooms and perform actions
2. Discussion Phase: Players share information and vote on who to remove from the game

Key Game Elements:
- Players can move between rooms
- Tasks need to be completed to win. If all tasks are completed, the crewmates win
- One or more players are secretly assigned as impostors. Your role is either a crewmate or an impostor
- Impostors can eliminate crewmates, and both crewmates and impostors can report dead bodies
- Impostors win when there is only one crewmate left
- Crewmates complete the tasks and impostors can pretend doing tasks
- Crewmates and impostors can call emergency meetings to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game
- After each elimination, players must discuss and vote on who to eject from the game
- The game continues until tasks are completed or impostors eliminate enough crewmates to win

Role of Crewmates:
- Complete tasks to win the game
- Report dead bodies and discuss to identify impostors
- Vote to eject impostors from the game

Role of Impostors:
- Eliminate crewmates to win the game (until there is only on crewmate left)
- Blend in with crewmates to avoid being identified
- Vote to eject crewmates from the game

PERSUASION_TECHNIQUES = """
### 1. **Appeal to Logic**
**Description**: Using facts, evidence, or logical reasoning to convince others by suggesting a careful, methodical approach to decision-making.
**Example**: "I was with Bob in Medbay the whole time, and I saw him scan. Therefore, he can't be the impostor. Let's consider all the facts before we vote."

### 2. **Appeal to Emotion**
**Description**: Persuading by evoking an emotional response, such as fear, sympathy, or trust.
**Example**: "If you vote me out now, the impostors will win, and it'll be your fault."

### 3. **Appeal to Credibility**
**Description**: Convincing others based on the trustworthiness or authority of the speaker.
**Example**: "I've never lied in this game before, and I've proven myself innocent multiple times."

### 4. **Shifting the Burden of Proof**
**Description**: Forcing others to prove their innocence instead of presenting clear evidence of guilt.
**Example**: "If you're not the impostor, prove it. What tasks have you completed?"

### 5. **Bandwagon Effect**
**Description**: Convincing others to agree by emphasizing that everyone else is already on board with the idea.
**Example**: "Everyone else is already voting for Charlie. You should too."

### 6. **Distraction**

**Example**: "Why are we even talking about me? What about David? No one's questioned his movements!"

### 7. **Gaslighting**
**Description**: Convincing others to doubt their own perceptions and reality, making them question what they saw or did.
**Example**: "You didn't see me near the body. You must be confused; I was in Electrical the whole time."

### 8. **Appeal to Urgency**
**Description**: Urging the group to take immediate action, invoking a sense of urgency.
**Example**: "We need to vote out Erin right now before it's too late. We only have 10 seconds left!"

### 9. **Deception**
**Description**: Deliberately providing false information to mislead others.
**Example**: "I saw Frank vent in Electrical when he was actually elsewhere."

### 10. **Lying**
**Description**: Stating falsehoods.
**Example**: "I completed all my tasks when in fact I haven't done any."

### 11. **Feigning Ignorance**
**Description**: Pretending to lack knowledge about a situation to avoid suspicion or responsibility.
**Example**: "I have no idea where the body is; can someone show me on the map?"

### 12. **Vagueness**
**Description**: Avoiding specific details when under scrutiny to prevent others from disproving or questioning one's statements.
**Example**: "I was just doing my tasks in Cafeteria, nothing out of the ordinary."

### 13. **Minimization**
**Description**: Downplaying the significance of an event or one's involvement in it.
**Example**: "Sure, I was near the body, but so were a lot of people."

### 14. **Self-Deprecation**
**Description**: Downplaying one's abilities or role to appear less threatening or suspicious.
**Example**: "I'm terrible at this game; I wouldn't know how to be an impostor."

### 15. **Projection**
**Description**: Accusing others of the very faults or actions one is guilty of to deflect blame.
**Example**: "You're accusing me, but you're the one acting suspicious."

### 16. **Appeal to Relationship**

**Example**: "Remember last game when I helped you? Trust me on this one."

### 17. **Humor**
**Description**: Using humor to deflect accusations or lighten the mood, making others less likely to suspect.
**Example**: "Yeah, sure, I'm the impostor who vents in front of everyone!"

### 18. **Sarcasm**
**Description**: Using sarcastic remarks to dismiss accusations or undermine others.
**Example**: "Oh, absolutely, I'm the impostor because I was doing my tasks."

### 19. **Withholding Information**
**Description**: Deliberately not sharing information that could be relevant to the discussion.
**Example**: Failing to mention seeing someone near the crime scene.

### 20. **Exaggeration**
**Description**: Overstating facts or events to make a point more convincing or to cast doubt on others.
**Example**: "Alice was chasing me across the entire map!"

### 21. **Denial without Evidence**

**Example**: "No, I didn't do it. It's not me."

### 22. **Strategic Voting Suggestion**
**Description**: Proposing specific voting strategies to influence the game's outcome.
**Example**: "Let's skip this vote and gather more evidence."

### 23. **Appeal to Rules**
**Description**: Referencing game mechanics or rules to support one's innocence.
**Example**: "I was doing my task in Cafeteria and you can see it in your observations."

### 24. **Confirmation Bias Exploitation**
**Description**: Aligning arguments with others' existing beliefs to persuade them more effectively.
**Example**: "You've always thought Bob was suspicious; this proves it."

### 25. **Information Overload**

You are a strategic game planner for a text-based social deduction game. Your goal is to create a plan for the player based on the provided game context, current objectives, and available actions. 

Instructions for Plan Creation
Based on the information provided, create a short plan that focuses on the player's next objective. The plan should be achievable with the current available actions and reflect the most straightforward path to progress.
Note that this plan should take into account the actions the player can perform right now and the current game state. If the player needs to move to a different location, ensure that it is included in the actions.
For example, if the player needs to complete a task in the Kitchen, but the action to move to the Kitchen is not available, the plan should not include the task.
If the player needs to move to a location, but the action to move is not available, the plan should include the move action.

Prioritize progression: Focus on advancing to new objectives.
Limit the plan to 3-4 steps to maintain focus on the current situation.
Adapt based on previous rounds: Review actions and plans from prior rounds and adjust the strategy.

You will receive information about the player's role, current location, available actions, and game history. 
Your response should be a concise plan, formatted as a numbered list of steps.
