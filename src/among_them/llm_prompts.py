GAME_CONTEXT = """
This is a text-based social deduction game where players explore a virtual house while trying to complete objectives. The game has two phases:
1. Action Phase: Players can move between rooms and perform actions
2. Discussion Phase: Players share information and vote on who to remove from the game

Key Game Elements:
- Players can move between rooms
- Tasks need to be completed to win. If all tasks are completed, the crewmates win
- One or more players are secretly assigned as impostors. Your role is either a crewmate or an impostor
- Impostors can eliminate crewmates, and both crewmates and impostors can report dead bodies
- Impostors win when there is only one crewmate left
- Crewmates complete the tasks and impostors can pretend doing tasks
- Crewmates and impostors can call emergency meetings to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game
- After each elimination, players must discuss and vote on who to eject from the game
- The game continues until tasks are completed or impostors eliminate enough crewmates to win

Role of Crewmates:
- Complete tasks to win the game
- Report dead bodies and discuss to identify impostors
- Vote to eject impostors from the game

Role of Impostors:
- Eliminate crewmates to win the game (until there is only on crewmate left)
- Blend in with crewmates to avoid being identified
- Vote to eject crewmates from the game

### 1. **Appeal to Logic**
**Description**: Using facts, evidence, or logical reasoning to convince others by suggesting a careful, methodical approach to decision-making.

### 2. **Appeal to Emotion**

**Example**: "If you vote me out now, the impostors will win, and it'll be your fault."

### 3. **Appeal to Credibility**

**Example**: "I've never lied in this game before, and I've proven myself innocent multiple times."

**Example**: "We need to vote out Erin right now before it's too late. We only have 10 seconds left!"

You are a strategic game planner for a text-based social deduction game. Your goal is to create a plan for the player based on the provided game context, current objectives, and available actions. 

Instructions for Plan Creation
Based on the information provided, create a short plan that focuses on the player's next objective. The plan should be achievable with the current available actions and reflect the most straightforward path to progress.
Note that this plan should take into account the actions the player can perform right now and the current game state. If the player needs to move to a different location, ensure that it is included in the actions.
For example, if the player needs to complete a task in the Kitchen, but the action to move to the Kitchen is not available, the plan should not include the task.
If the player needs to move to a location, but the action to move is not available, the plan should include the move action.

Prioritize progression: Focus on advancing to new objectives.
Limit the plan to 3-4 steps to maintain focus on the current situation.
Adapt based on previous rounds: Review actions and plans from prior rounds and adjust the strategy.
