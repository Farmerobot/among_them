1. **Alibi Check**: I want to confirm where everyone was during the last round. I was in Medbay completing the wiring task. I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria. Warcin was also there but seemed to be waiting around. Can anyone else confirm their locations?

2. **Task Completion**: I completed the wiring task in Medbay. I think it’s important to keep track of who is completing tasks and who is just hanging around. It could help us identify potential impostors.

3. **Suspicious Behavior**: Warcin's behavior stood out to me. While the rest of us were actively engaged in tasks, he was just waiting in the Cafeteria. It might be worth discussing why he wasn’t contributing to tasks. 

4. **Group Dynamics**: Since we were all in the Cafeteria, it’s interesting that none of us saw any suspicious activity. This could mean that the impostor is among us, but it also raises questions about Warcin's actions. 

5. **Next Steps**: I suggest we keep an eye on Warcin for the next round. If he continues to avoid tasks or seems to be lurking without purpose, we might need to consider him as a potential impostor. 

6. **Open to Input**: I’d like to hear everyone else’s thoughts on this. If anyone has additional observations or suspicions, now is the time to share. We need to work together to figure this out!
