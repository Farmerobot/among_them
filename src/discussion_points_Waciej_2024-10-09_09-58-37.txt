1. **Alibi Check**: I want to confirm where everyone was during the last round. I was in Medbay completing the wiring task. I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in Cafeteria. Warcin was also there but seemed to be waiting around. Can anyone confirm their tasks or whereabouts during that time?

2. **Warcin's Behavior**: I noticed Warcin was just waiting in Cafeteria while others were actively working on tasks. This could be suspicious behavior. What was Warcin doing? Did anyone see him move to another location or complete any tasks?

3. **Task Completion**: I completed the wiring task in Medbay. I think it’s important to keep track of who is completing tasks and who isn’t. If anyone has seen others completing tasks, it would help us narrow down who might be acting suspiciously.

4. **Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj**: Since I saw all three of you in Cafeteria, can you each share what tasks you were doing? It’s crucial to verify that you were indeed working on tasks and not just faking it.

5. **Trust and Accountability**: I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. If anyone has any suspicions or has seen something unusual, now is the time to speak up. We need to work together to figure out who the impostor might be.

6. **Vote Strategy**: I suggest we hold off on voting until we have more information. It’s easy to jump to conclusions, but we need to ensure we’re making informed decisions based on everyone’s input.

7. **Final Thoughts**: Let’s keep an eye on the players who are not contributing to the discussion or providing alibis. It’s often the quieter players who might be hiding something. I’m looking forward to hearing everyone’s thoughts!
