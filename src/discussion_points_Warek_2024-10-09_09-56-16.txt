1. **Observation of Tasks**: I noticed that both Wateusz and Wikolaj were actively doing tasks in the cafeteria while I was there. This gives them some credibility as crewmates since they were engaged in tasks. However, we need to keep an eye on their movements after I left.

2. **Warcin's Behavior**: I saw Warcin waiting in the cafeteria while Wateusz was completing his task. This behavior is a bit suspicious, especially since I later witnessed Warcin kill Wateusz. I think we should focus on Warcin as a primary suspect.

3. **Movement Patterns**: After I completed my task in the cafeteria, I moved to the admin room. I didn't see anyone else in the admin room when I arrived. It’s important to note that Waciej moved to medbay from the cafeteria, which could be relevant if we need to account for alibis.

4. **Wikola's Alibi**: While I saw Wikolaj doing tasks in the cafeteria, I can't confirm his actions after I left. We should ask him where he went after I moved to admin. If he has a solid alibi, it could help us narrow down the suspects.

5. **Call for Transparency**: I encourage everyone to share their movements and tasks completed during this round. The more information we have, the better we can identify who might be lying or acting suspiciously.

6. **Vote Strategy**: Given that I witnessed Warcin commit the act, I believe we should consider voting him out first. If we vote him out and he turns out to be innocent, we can then focus on the remaining players based on their alibis and behaviors. 

Let’s discuss this further and see if anyone has additional insights or observations!
