Alright everyone, I need to share some critical information based on what I observed in the cafeteria.

1. **Warcin's Actions**: I witnessed Warcin kill Wateusz right in front of me while I was in the cafeteria. This is a clear indication that Warcin is the impostor. I know it might be hard to believe, but I was there, and I saw it happen.

2. **Wateusz and Wikolaj**: Both Wateusz and Wikolaj were doing tasks in the cafeteria when I was there. I can vouch for their actions as they were both occupied with their tasks and did not exhibit any suspicious behavior.

3. **Waciej's Movement**: I noticed Waciej moving to the Medbay from the cafeteria. While I can't confirm his actions there, itâ€™s worth noting that he was not present during the incident with Warcin.

4. **Wikola's Consistency**: Wikolaj has been consistent in his task completion, and I believe he is a safe player to trust at this point. 

5. **My Location**: After witnessing the murder, I moved to the Admin room to report what I saw. I am alone in this room now, and I urge you all to consider my testimony seriously.

Given this information, I strongly believe we should vote to banish Warcin. He is the only one who has shown clear evidence of being the impostor. Let's discuss this further, but I urge you to trust my observations.
