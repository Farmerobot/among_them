1. **Observation of Tasks**: I completed the task of starting the coffee maker in the cafeteria, and I also saw Wateusz and Warek both doing tasks in the same area. This indicates that they were actively participating in crew activities.

2. **Warcin's Actions**: I have a serious concern about Warcin. I witnessed him kill Wateusz right in front of me while we were in the cafeteria. This is a clear indication of him being the impostor. 

3. **Warek's Movement**: After I saw Warcin kill Wateusz, I noticed that Warek moved to the admin room. While I can't confirm his innocence, I can say that he was not involved in the murder I witnessed.

4. **Waciej's Movement**: I also saw Waciej moving to the medbay from the cafeteria. I didn't see him commit any suspicious actions, but his movement could be worth discussing further.

5. **Warcin's Defense**: I urge everyone to consider how Warcin might try to defend himself. He may attempt to shift blame onto others or create confusion. We should remain vigilant and focus on the facts.

6. **Next Steps**: I suggest we discuss Warcin's actions further and consider voting him out based on the evidence I provided. We need to ensure the safety of the crew and eliminate the impostor before more harm is done.

7. **Open to Questions**: I'm open to any questions or clarifications about what I saw. It's important that we all share our observations to make an informed decision.
