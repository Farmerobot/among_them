1. **Observation of Tasks**: I noticed that both Wateusz and Warek were actively completing tasks in the cafeteria when I was there. This suggests they were engaged in crewmate activities. However, I also saw Warcin just waiting around, which is suspicious behavior.

2. **The Incident**: I witnessed Warcin kill Wateusz right in front of me. This is a clear indication of Warcin's guilt. I think we should focus our attention on him as the primary suspect.

3. **Warek's Movement**: After the incident, I saw Warek move to Admin. While this doesn't directly implicate him, it does show he was not present during the murder. It might be worth asking him what tasks he was doing in Admin to confirm his alibi.

4. **Waciej's Location**: I also saw Waciej move to Medbay from the cafeteria. I haven't seen him since, so it would be good to check in with him about what he was doing there. If he has a solid alibi, it could help us narrow down our suspicions.

5. **Warcin's Defense**: I expect Warcin might try to deflect blame onto others or claim he was doing tasks. We should be cautious of any excuses he makes and focus on the fact that I directly witnessed him commit the murder.

6. **Next Steps**: I propose we vote to banish Warcin based on my observation. If we don't act now, we risk losing more crewmates. We should also keep an eye on Warek and Waciej for any suspicious behavior moving forward.

7. **Open Discussion**: I encourage everyone to share their observations and any tasks they completed. The more information we have, the better we can make our decision. Let's work together to identify the impostor!
