1. **Observation of Tasks**: I was in the cafeteria and saw Wateusz and Warek both actively working on their tasks. This indicates they were engaged in crewmate activities. However, I also noticed Warcin just waiting around, which seemed suspicious.

2. **The Incident**: I witnessed Warcin kill Wateusz right in front of me. This is a clear indication of his guilt. I believe we need to focus on Warcin as the primary suspect for this round.

3. **Warek's Movement**: After the incident, I saw Warek move to the Admin room. While I can't confirm his actions there, his earlier task completion in the cafeteria suggests he was not involved in any foul play at that moment.

4. **Waciej's Movement**: I also observed Waciej moving to Medbay from the cafeteria. I didn't see anything suspicious about him, but it’s worth noting that he was not present during the incident.

5. **Call for Action**: Given that I directly witnessed Warcin commit the act, I strongly urge everyone to consider voting for Warcin this round. We need to eliminate the impostor to ensure the safety of the crew.

6. **Encouragement for Others to Share**: I encourage everyone else to share their observations and experiences from this round. If anyone else saw something that could corroborate my claims or provide additional insights, it would be helpful for our decision-making.

7. **Caution Against Misdirection**: We should be cautious of any attempts from Warcin to deflect blame or create confusion. Let’s stay focused on the facts and not get sidetracked by any misleading statements. 

Let’s work together to ensure we make the right choice this round!
