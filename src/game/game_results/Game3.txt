Discussion log:
[Rarcin]: I saw Rojtek and Rateusz both leave the cafeteria, but I didn't see anything suspicious. Warcin and I ended up in Medbay together. Anyone else have any info?
[Rateusz]: I can confirm that I left the cafeteria and went to Weapons. I didn't see anything suspicious either. Rarcin, did you notice anyone else in Medbay besides you and Warcin?
[Warcin]: I didn't see anyone else in Medbay besides Rarcin and me. Rateusz, did you see anyone else in Weapons?
[Rarcin]: [Rarcin]: I didn't see anyone else in Medbay besides Warcin and me. Rateusz, did you see anyone else in Weapons?
[Rateusz]: I didn't see anyone else in Weapons. It seems like Medbay was pretty crowded, though. Rojtek, what were you doing in Medbay?
[Warcin]: I didn't see Rojtek doing anything in Medbay before he was killed. Rarcin, did you notice anything unusual when we were there?
[Rarcin]: [Rarcin]: I didn't notice anything unusual in Medbay either. It seems like Rojtek might have been there before us, but I didn't see him. Warcin, did you see Rojtek at all when you arrived?
[Rateusz]: I didn't see Rojtek in Medbay either, but it's strange that both Rarcin and Warcin didn't notice him if he was there before them. Maybe he left quickly? Or someone is not being entirely truthful.
[Warcin]: It's possible that Rojtek left Medbay quickly before we noticed him. Rarcin and I were focused on our tasks, so we might have missed him. Rateusz, did you see anyone else moving around near Weapons or Cafeteria?
[Rarcin]: It's interesting that none of us saw Rojtek in Medbay. If he was there before us, he must have left quickly. Rateusz, did you see anyone else moving around near Weapons or Cafeteria?
[Rateusz]: I didn't see anyone else near Weapons or Cafeteria after I left. It's odd that Rojtek wasn't seen by either of you in Medbay. Maybe he left quickly, but it does seem suspicious. We should keep an eye on Warcin and Rarcin since they were the last ones in Medbay.
[Warcin]: It's definitely strange that none of us saw Rojtek in Medbay. Maybe he left quickly, but it's also possible someone is trying to cover their tracks. Rateusz, you mentioned you didn't see anyone else near Weapons or Cafeteria. Could it be that someone vented?
[Rarcin]: It's definitely possible that someone vented. We should consider that as a possibility. But for now, we need more information. Rateusz, did you notice any vents in Weapons that could connect to Medbay or Cafeteria?
