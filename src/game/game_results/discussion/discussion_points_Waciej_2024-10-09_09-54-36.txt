1. **Alibi Check**: I was in Medbay completing the wiring task, and I noticed that I was alone in the room. This means I can confirm that I was not involved in any suspicious activities during that time. 

2. **Cafeteria Observations**: While I was in the Cafeteria, I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks. This gives them a potential alibi for that time. However, I did see Warcin just waiting around, which is a bit suspicious. It’s important to consider what he was doing during that time.

3. **Task Completion**: I completed the wiring task in Medbay, which is a common task for crewmates. I encourage others to share their task completions as well. If anyone has been avoiding tasks or has no clear alibi, that could be a red flag.

4. **Warcin's Behavior**: I want to bring attention to Warcin's behavior in the Cafeteria. While the others were actively engaged in tasks, he was just waiting. This could indicate he was trying to avoid being seen doing anything suspicious. 

5. **Trustworthiness of Observations**: I think it’s crucial for us to discuss our observations and see if anyone else saw the same things I did. If anyone has different accounts of what happened in the Cafeteria, we should compare notes.

6. **Next Steps**: I suggest we keep an eye on Warcin and see if he can provide a solid explanation for his behavior. If he can't, we might need to consider him as a potential suspect. 

7. **Voting Strategy**: Before we vote, let’s make sure we have enough information. I’d like to hear from everyone about their tasks and whereabouts to ensure we’re making an informed decision. 

Let’s work together to figure this out!
