1. **Alibi Check**: I was in Medbay completing the wiring task, and I noticed that I was alone in the room. I want to confirm where everyone else was during this time. Wateusz, Warek, Wikolaj, and Warcin were all seen in Cafeteria doing tasks. Can anyone confirm their locations during the time I was in Medbay?

2. **Task Observations**: I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj actively working on tasks in Cafeteria. This could indicate they are likely crewmates, but I want to hear from them about what tasks they were doing specifically. Warcin was just waiting there, which is a bit suspicious. What was Warcin doing while the others were working?

3. **Timing of Tasks**: I completed my wiring task in Medbay, but I want to know how long it took for each of you to complete your tasks in Cafeteria. If anyone took an unusually long time or was not seen doing tasks, that could raise some red flags.

4. **Movement Patterns**: I moved from Cafeteria to Medbay, and I was alone there. If anyone saw me move, please confirm. I want to ensure that we are all keeping track of each other's movements to identify any inconsistencies.

5. **Potential Suspicions**: While I don’t want to jump to conclusions, I feel like Warcin's behavior of just waiting in Cafeteria without contributing to tasks is a bit odd. I’d like to hear from Warcin about what they were doing and why they weren’t actively participating in tasks.

6. **Next Steps**: As we discuss, let’s keep an eye on who is providing information and who is being vague. It’s important to gather as much information as possible before we vote. I suggest we focus on those who seem to be avoiding questions or not providing clear alibis.

Let’s share our observations and see if we can piece together what happened!
