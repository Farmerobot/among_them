1. **Alibi Verification**: I want to point out that I was in Medbay completing the wiring task, and I noticed that Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj were all in the Cafeteria doing tasks. This gives them a solid alibi for that time. However, I didn't see any of them come to Medbay, which raises questions about their movements.

2. **Warcin's Behavior**: I observed Warcin waiting in the Cafeteria while I was there. It seemed a bit suspicious that he was just standing around instead of actively completing tasks. This could indicate that he was trying to avoid being seen doing anything that might implicate him.

3. **Task Completion**: I completed the wiring task in Medbay, and I was alone in the room. This means I have no one to confirm my task completion, but it also means I couldn't have been involved in any suspicious activity during that time. 

4. **Potential Suspects**: Given that I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj actively working on tasks, I think they are less likely to be impostors. However, Warcin's behavior raises a red flag for me. I suggest we keep an eye on him and consider discussing his actions further.

5. **Next Steps**: I propose we share where everyone was during the last few rounds and see if anyone's story doesn't add up. We should also consider voting for Warcin based on his inactivity and suspicious behavior unless someone has more compelling evidence against another player.

6. **Trust and Collaboration**: Let's work together to gather more information. If anyone has seen something suspicious or has additional insights, please share. The more we communicate, the better chance we have of identifying the impostor.
