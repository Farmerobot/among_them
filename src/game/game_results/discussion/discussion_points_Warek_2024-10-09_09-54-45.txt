1. **Observation of Tasks**: I noticed that both Wateusz and Wikolaj were actively doing tasks in the cafeteria while I was there. This gives them some credibility as crewmates since they were engaged in tasks.

2. **Movement of Waciej**: I saw Waciej move from the cafeteria to the Medbay. While I can't confirm what he did there, it’s worth noting that he was not present during the incident.

3. **Warcin's Actions**: I have to bring up that I witnessed Warcin kill Wateusz in the cafeteria. This is a serious accusation, and I believe we need to discuss this further. I was alone in the room when it happened, and I think we should consider voting for Warcin based on this evidence.

4. **Wikolaj's Behavior**: While I saw Wikolaj doing tasks, I think we should keep an eye on him as well. Just because he was doing tasks doesn’t mean he’s innocent. We need to gather more information about his movements after I left the cafeteria.

5. **Next Steps**: I suggest we focus our discussion on Warcin and see if anyone else has additional information or observations that could either support or contradict my claim. If we can come to a consensus, we should consider voting for Warcin to ensure the safety of the crew.

6. **Trust and Alibis**: I’d like to hear from everyone about where they were during the time of the murder. It’s important to establish alibis and see if anyone else has seen something suspicious.

Let’s work together to figure this out and keep the crew safe!
