1. **Observation of Warcin**: I want to bring attention to Warcin. While I was in the cafeteria, I saw him waiting around, and shortly after, I witnessed him kill Wateusz. This is a crucial piece of information that we need to consider seriously. I believe we should focus our attention on him.

2. **Wateusz and Wikolaj's Tasks**: Both Wateusz and Wikolaj were actively doing tasks in the cafeteria when I was there. This indicates they were engaged in crewmate activities. I think it's important to note that Wateusz was not only doing his task but was also a victim, which further supports my claim against Warcin.

3. **Waciej's Movement**: I noticed Waciej moved to the Medbay from the cafeteria. While I can't confirm his actions there, itâ€™s worth discussing whether anyone saw him or if he has any alibi for that time. We should keep an eye on him as well, but my main focus is on Warcin.

4. **Wikola's Consistency**: Wikolaj was consistently doing tasks in the cafeteria, and I didn't see any suspicious behavior from him. I think we should consider him a potential ally in this round. 

5. **Call for Transparency**: I urge everyone to share their locations and actions during the time Wateusz was killed. The more information we have, the better we can assess who might be lying or trying to mislead us.

6. **Next Steps**: Given the evidence I presented, I believe we should vote to banish Warcin. If anyone has any counter-evidence or different observations, now is the time to speak up. We need to act quickly to ensure the safety of the crew.
