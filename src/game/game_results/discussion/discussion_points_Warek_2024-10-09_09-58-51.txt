1. **Observation of Warcin**: I want to bring attention to Warcin's behavior in the cafeteria. I saw him waiting there while Wateusz was doing a task. This could be seen as suspicious, especially since I later witnessed him kill Wateusz. I believe we need to consider Warcin as a strong suspect for this round.

2. **Wikolaj's Actions**: While I was in the cafeteria, I noticed that Wikolaj was actively doing tasks. I didn't see anything suspicious about him, but I think we should keep an eye on him as well. It's important to differentiate between those who are actively contributing to tasks and those who are not.

3. **Waciej's Movement**: I saw Waciej move from the cafeteria to the medbay. While I didn't see anything incriminating, his movement could be relevant. We should ask him what tasks he was doing in medbay to ensure he has a solid alibi.

4. **My Own Actions**: I moved to the admin room after completing my task in the cafeteria. I was alone there, which means I have no one to vouch for my whereabouts. However, I can confirm that I did not kill anyone and was not involved in any suspicious activity.

5. **Call for Transparency**: I think itâ€™s crucial for everyone to share their tasks and locations during the last round. This will help us piece together the timeline of events and identify any inconsistencies in players' stories.

6. **Vote Strategy**: Given the evidence against Warcin, I suggest we consider voting him out this round. If we don't act on this information, we risk losing another crewmate. 

7. **Encouragement for Discussion**: I encourage everyone to share their observations and thoughts. The more information we have, the better our chances of identifying the impostor. Let's work together to ensure we make the right decision.
