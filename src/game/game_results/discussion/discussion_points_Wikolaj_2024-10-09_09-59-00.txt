1. **Observation of Tasks**: I was in the cafeteria and saw Wateusz and Warek both actively working on their tasks. This indicates they were engaged in crewmate activities. I also noticed Warcin just waiting around, which seemed suspicious.

2. **The Incident**: I witnessed Warcin kill Wateusz right in front of me. This is a clear indication of Warcin being the impostor. I think we should focus our attention on him.

3. **Warek's Movement**: After the incident, I saw Warek move to the admin area. While I can't confirm his actions there, his earlier task completion in the cafeteria suggests he was not involved in the kill.

4. **Waciej's Movement**: I also saw Waciej move to the medbay from the cafeteria. I haven't seen anything suspicious from him, but I think we should keep an eye on him as well, just in case.

5. **Call for Action**: Given that I directly witnessed Warcin commit the act, I strongly believe we should vote to banish him. If we let him stay, he could potentially eliminate more crewmates.

6. **Encouraging Discussion**: I encourage everyone to share their observations. If anyone else saw something different or has suspicions about other players, now is the time to speak up. We need to work together to identify the impostor.

7. **Trust and Alibis**: Let's discuss our alibis and what tasks we were doing. This will help us piece together the timeline and confirm who was where during the incident. 

8. **Final Thoughts**: Remember, we have limited rounds to discuss this. We need to make a decision soon to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates. I urge everyone to consider the evidence and vote wisely.
