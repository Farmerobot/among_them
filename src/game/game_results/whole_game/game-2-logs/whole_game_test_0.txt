Discussion log:
[Waciej]: I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the cafeteria, so they seem clear to me. I also saw them move to the medbay, but I didn't follow them there. I was alone in weapons and O2 completing tasks.
[Warek]: I can confirm that Wateusz, Waciej, and Wikolaj were all doing tasks in the cafeteria. I also saw Wateusz and Wikolaj doing tasks in the medbay. However, I saw Warcin kill Wateusz in storage. Warcin is the impostor.
[Wikolaj]: I can confirm that I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Warek doing tasks in the cafeteria. I also saw Wateusz and Warek doing tasks in the medbay. However, I didn't see Warcin in storage, so I can't confirm Warek's accusation.
[Warcin]: [Warcin]: I was in electrical and then moved to storage. I saw Warek there, but I didn't see him do any tasks. Warek is trying to frame me because he knows I saw him near the body.
[Waciej]: Based on what I've seen, I can confirm that Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj were all doing tasks in the cafeteria. I didn't see Warcin in storage, so I can't confirm or deny Warek's accusation. However, Warek's claim that he saw Warcin kill Wateusz in storage is serious. We need more information from others who might have been near storage to verify this.
[Warek]: I understand that it's hard to believe without more witnesses, but I clearly saw Warcin kill Wateusz in storage. I was alone in electrical before moving to storage, and that's when I saw the kill. Warcin is trying to deflect blame onto me. We need to vote him out.
[Wikolaj]: Based on my observations, I can confirm that I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Warek doing tasks in the cafeteria and medbay. I didn't see Warcin in storage, so I can't confirm Warek's accusation. However, Warek has been consistent in his statements and I did see him doing tasks in multiple locations. Warcin's movements seem a bit suspicious, especially since he was seen moving from medbay to upper engine and then claims to have been in electrical and storage. We need more information, but I'm leaning towards Warek's account being truthful.
[Warcin]: I understand Warek's accusation, but it's not true. I was in electrical alone before moving to storage, and that's when I saw Warek near the body. Warek is trying to shift the blame onto me. We need to consider all possibilities and not rush to judgment.
[Waciej]: Based on what I've seen and the statements so far, I can confirm that Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj were all doing tasks in the cafeteria. I didn't see Warcin in storage, so I can't confirm or deny Warek's accusation. However, Warek's claim that he saw Warcin kill Wateusz in storage is serious. We need more information from others who might have been near storage to verify this.
[Warek]: Based on my observations, I can confirm that I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Wikolaj doing tasks in the cafeteria and medbay. I also saw Warcin moving suspiciously from medbay to upper engine and then to storage. I was alone in electrical before moving to storage, where I witnessed Warcin kill Wateusz. Warcin's movements don't add up, and he's trying to deflect blame onto me. We need to vote him out to ensure the safety of the crew.

[Warcin]: I understand the suspicion, but Warek's story doesn't add up. He claims he was alone in electrical before moving to storage, but I was in electrical alone before moving to storage. If Warek was really in electrical, he would have seen me there. He's trying to frame me to cover his own tracks. We need to consider this carefully.
