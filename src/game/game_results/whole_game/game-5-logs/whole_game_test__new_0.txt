[Wikolaj]: GameActionType.REPORT | [Waciej]
Discussion log:
[Wateusz]: I've seen Warek doing tasks in Weapons and O2, so I can vouch for him. I also saw Waciej and Wikolaj doing tasks in Cafeteria earlier. Warcin moved to Medbay from Cafeteria, but I haven't seen him do any tasks yet.
[Warek]: I can confirm what Wateusz said. I saw him doing tasks in Weapons and O2. I also saw Waciej and Wikolaj doing tasks in Cafeteria. However, I haven't seen Warcin do any tasks yet either. We should keep an eye on him.
[Wikolaj]: I can confirm that I saw Waciej doing tasks in Cafeteria. I also saw Warcin moving to Medbay from Cafeteria, but I haven't seen him do any tasks either. We should definitely keep an eye on Warcin.
[Warcin]: I understand why you might be suspicious of me since I haven't been seen doing tasks. However, I did see Waciej and Wikolaj doing tasks in Cafeteria earlier, and I saw Wateusz moving from Cafeteria to Weapons. I was moving around a lot trying to find tasks to do, which is why you might not have seen me doing any. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly.
[Wateusz]: I think we should focus on finding more evidence before making any decisions. Warcin, can you tell us what tasks you've completed so far and where? It would help us clear up any doubts.
[Warek]: Warcin, you mentioned moving around a lot to find tasks, but can you specify which tasks you've completed and where? It would help us clear up any doubts. So far, I haven't seen you doing any tasks, and that's concerning.
[Wikolaj]: I agree with Wateusz and Warek. Warcin, can you specify which tasks you've completed and where? It's important for us to clear up any doubts. So far, I haven't seen you doing any tasks either, and that's concerning.
[Warcin]: I understand the concern. I was in Medbay earlier but didn't get to complete any tasks there. I did see Waciej and Wikolaj doing tasks in Cafeteria, and I saw Wateusz moving to Weapons. I was in Electrical for a bit, but I didn't see anyone else there. I think we should focus on gathering more evidence before making any decisions.
[Wateusz]: I think it's important to note that Warcin hasn't provided any specific tasks he's completed, which is concerning. I've seen Warek, Waciej, and Wikolaj doing tasks, but I haven't seen Warcin complete any. Warcin, can you give us more details on what tasks you were trying to do in Electrical? This might help us understand your movements better.
[Warek]: I agree with Wateusz. Warcin hasn't provided any specific tasks he's completed, which is concerning. I've seen everyone else doing tasks, but not Warcin. Warcin, can you give us more details on what tasks you were trying to do in Electrical? This might help us understand your movements better.
[Wikolaj]: I agree with Wateusz and Warek. Warcin hasn't provided any specific tasks he's completed, which is concerning. I've seen everyone else doing tasks, but not Warcin. Warcin, can you give us more details on what tasks you were trying to do in Electrical? This might help us understand your movements better.
[Warcin]: I understand the concern. In Electrical, I was trying to fix the wiring, but I didn't get to complete it before moving to Storage. I saw Wateusz doing a task there. I think we should gather more evidence before making any decisions.
[Wateusz]: I think it's important to note that Warcin's explanation about trying to fix wiring in Electrical doesn't align with my observations. I was in Storage and didn't see him there until much later. Also, he hasn't provided any specific tasks he's completed, which is still concerning. We need to be cautious, but Warcin's lack of task completion is suspicious.
[Warek]: Based on what I've seen, I agree with Wateusz. Warcin's explanation about trying to fix wiring in Electrical doesn't align with my observations either. I haven't seen him complete any tasks, and his movements seem inconsistent. We should be cautious, but Warcin's lack of task completion is definitely suspicious.
[Wikolaj]: I agree with Wateusz and Warek. Warcin's explanation about trying to fix wiring in Electrical doesn't align with my observations either. I was in Electrical for a while completing tasks, and I didn't see him there. His lack of task completion and inconsistent movements are definitely suspicious. We should keep a close eye on him.
[Warcin]: I understand your concerns, but I think we're jumping to conclusions too quickly. I was indeed in Electrical trying to fix the wiring, but I moved to Storage when I saw Wateusz there. I haven't had the chance to complete many tasks because I've been moving around a lot. Let's focus on gathering more evidence before making any hasty decisions.
[Wateusz]: I agree with Warek and Wikolaj. Warcin's explanation about trying to fix wiring in Electrical doesn't align with my observations either.
