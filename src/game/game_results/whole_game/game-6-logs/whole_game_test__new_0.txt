Discussion log:
[Wateusz]: I've seen Warek doing tasks consistently in multiple locations, including the cafeteria and weapons. I can vouch for him. Waciej also seemed to be doing tasks in the cafeteria before moving to medbay. I haven't seen anything suspicious from either of them.
[Waciej]: I agree with Wateusz. I saw both Wateusz and Warek doing tasks in the cafeteria. I haven't seen anything suspicious from them either. However, I've noticed Warcin moving around a lot without doing any tasks. This seems a bit suspicious to me.
[Warek]: I agree with Wateusz and Waciej. I've seen both of them doing tasks in the cafeteria and weapons. I haven't seen anything suspicious from them. However, I haven't seen Warcin doing any tasks either, just moving around a lot. This does seem suspicious.
[Warcin]: I understand why you might think that, but I've been moving around to check on everyone and make sure tasks are being done. I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Warek all doing tasks in the cafeteria, and I saw Wikolaj doing a task in electrical before I moved to storage. I haven't seen anything suspicious from anyone yet.

[Wateusz]: [Wateusz]: I appreciate Warcin's explanation, but I still find it odd that he hasn't been seen doing any tasks. We need to be cautious. Wikolaj has been quiet, and we haven't heard much from him. Does anyone have any observations about Wikolaj?
[Waciej]: I agree with Wateusz and Warek. Warcin has been moving around a lot without doing any tasks, which is suspicious. I haven't seen Wikolaj much either, so we should keep an eye on both of them.
[Warek]: I agree with Wateusz and Waciej. I've seen both of them doing tasks consistently. Warcin's explanation makes sense, but it's still odd that he hasn't been seen doing any tasks. I haven't seen much of Wikolaj either, so we should definitely keep an eye on both Warcin and Wikolaj.
[Warcin]: I understand the concern about my movements, but I was genuinely checking on everyone to ensure tasks were being completed. I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Warek doing tasks in the cafeteria, and I saw Wikolaj doing a task in electrical before I moved to storage. I haven't seen anything suspicious from anyone yet. However, since we haven't heard much from Wikolaj, and now he's missing, it might be worth considering his last known location and who was around him.
