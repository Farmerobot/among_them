Discussion log:
[Wateusz]: I saw Waciej and Warek doing tasks in the cafeteria, so they seem clear to me. Wikolaj and Warcin both moved to the medbay from the cafeteria, but I didn't see them do any tasks. Anyone have more info on what happened in the medbay?
[Waciej]: I can confirm that I saw Wateusz and Warek doing tasks in the cafeteria. I didn't see what happened in the medbay either, but it's suspicious that both Wikolaj and Warcin moved there around the same time. We should keep an eye on them.
[Warek]: [Warek]: I saw Warcin kill Wikolaj in the medbay. We need to vote Warcin out.
[Warcin]: [Warcin]: That's a bold accusation, Warek. I was in the medbay, but I didn't kill anyone. I saw Wikolaj enter the medbay, but I didn't see him after that. Maybe someone else came in after me and did it. Warek, you were in the cafeteria earlier, how did you end up in the medbay so quickly?
[Wateusz]: Based on what I've seen, I can confirm that Waciej and Warek were doing tasks in the cafeteria, so they seem trustworthy to me. Warek's accusation against Warcin is serious, and since I saw Warek move to the medbay from the cafeteria, it's possible he witnessed the kill. Warcin, your defense seems weak since you admit to being in the medbay but didn't see anyone else. I'm inclined to believe Warek's account for now.

Warek's accusation against Warcin is serious, and since I saw Warek move to the medbay from the cafeteria, it's possible he witnessed the kill. Warcin, your defense seems weak since you admit to being in the medbay but didn't see anyone else. I'm inclined to believe Warek's account for now.
[Warek]: [Warek]: I understand that my accusation is serious, but I clearly saw Warcin kill Wikolaj in the medbay. I moved to the medbay right after completing my task in the cafeteria, and that's when I witnessed the kill. Warcin's defense doesn't add up, and we need to vote him out to keep the crew safe.
[Warcin]: Warcin: Warek, your story doesn't add up. You claim to have seen me kill Wikolaj, but I didn't see you in the medbay at all. If you were really there, why didn't you report the body immediately? It seems like you're trying to frame me to cover your own tracks.

[Warek]: Warcin, your defense doesn't make sense. I moved to the medbay right after completing my task in the cafeteria, and I clearly saw you kill Wikolaj. If you were innocent, you would have reported the body instead of trying to deflect blame. We need to vote Warcin out to keep the crew safe.
[Warcin]: Warcin: Warek, your story still doesn't add up. If you saw me kill Wikolaj, why didn't you report it immediately? It seems like you're trying to shift the blame onto me. I was in the medbay, but I didn't see you there at all. Maybe you came in after I left and found the body. Wateusz and Waciej, you both saw Warek in the cafeteria, but did you see him leave for the medbay?

[Warcin]: Warcin: Wateusz and Waciej, you both saw Warek doing tasks in the cafeteria, but did you actually see him leave for the medbay? Warek's story has inconsistencies. If he saw me kill Wikolaj, why didn't he report it immediately? It seems like he's trying to frame me to cover his own tracks. I was in the medbay, but I didn't see Warek there at all. Maybe he came in after I left and found the body.
