[Waciej]: GameActionType.REPORT | [Warek]
Discussion log:
[Wateusz]: I saw Waciej doing tasks in the cafeteria, so I think they're clear. I also saw Warek and Warcin move to the medbay from the cafeteria. Anyone see anything suspicious in the medbay?
[Waciej]: I saw Warcin kill Warek in the medbay. We should vote to banish Warcin.
[Wikolaj]: I can confirm that I saw Warek and Warcin move to the medbay from the cafeteria. I didn't see what happened in the medbay, but if Waciej saw Warcin kill Warek, that sounds pretty suspicious.
[Warcin]: [Warcin]: I did move to the medbay with Warek, but I didn't kill him. Waciej is trying to frame me. Why would I kill someone with another person in the room? It doesn't make sense. Maybe Waciej is the impostor trying to shift the blame.
[Wateusz]: Based on what I've seen, I can confirm that Waciej was doing tasks in the cafeteria, which makes me trust them. However, I didn't see what happened in the medbay. If Waciej saw Warcin kill Warek, thatâ€™s pretty strong evidence. Warcin, why would Waciej lie about this?
[Waciej]: Warcin, I saw you kill Warek in the medbay with my own eyes. There's no reason for me to lie about this. Wateusz and Wikolaj can both confirm that you and Warek moved to the medbay. The evidence is clear. We need to banish Warcin.
[Wikolaj]: Given what we've seen and heard, I think it's important to focus on the facts. I can confirm that both Warek and Warcin moved to the medbay from the cafeteria. While I didn't see what happened in the medbay, Waciej's claim that Warcin killed Warek is strong, especially since Waciej was seen doing tasks earlier and seems trustworthy. Warcin's defense doesn't add up, as it's unlikely Waciej would lie with so many witnesses. I think we should consider banishing Warcin based on the evidence presented.
[Warcin]: Waciej, you're trying too hard to push the blame on me. If you really saw me kill Warek, why didn't you report it immediately? Instead, you waited until the discussion phase to bring it up. That seems suspicious to me. Maybe you're the impostor trying to get rid of an innocent crewmate.
[Wateusz]: Based on what I've seen, I trust Waciej since I saw them doing tasks in the cafeteria. Warcin, your defense doesn't add up. If Waciej saw you kill Warek, that's strong evidence against you. Why would Waciej lie when multiple people can confirm your movements? I think we should banish Warcin.
[Waciej]: Warcin, I didn't report immediately because I wanted to gather more information and make sure I wasn't missing anything. But now that we're in the discussion phase, it's clear to me that you killed Warek. Wateusz and Wikolaj can confirm your movements, and I saw you do it. We need to banish Warcin to keep the crew safe.
[Wikolaj]: Given the evidence and the fact that both Wateusz and I saw Waciej doing tasks in the cafeteria, I find Waciej's account credible. Warcin's defense seems weak, especially since multiple people can confirm the movements to the medbay. I think we should banish Warcin based on the strong evidence presented by Waciej.
[Warcin]: Waciej, you're being too aggressive in pushing the blame on me. If you really saw me kill Warek, why didn't you report it immediately? Instead, you waited until the discussion phase to bring it up. That seems suspicious to me. Maybe you're the impostor trying to get rid of an innocent crewmate.
[Wateusz]: Based on what I've seen and the evidence presented, I trust Waciej. I saw them doing tasks in the cafeteria, which makes them credible. Warcin, your defense doesn't add up, especially since multiple people can confirm your movements to the medbay. I think we should banish Warcin to keep the crew safe.

[Waciej]: Warcin, your argument doesn't hold up. I didn't report immediately because I wanted to gather more information and ensure I wasn't making a mistake. But now, with the discussion phase and the corroboration from Wateusz and Wikolaj, it's clear you killed Warek. We need to banish Warcin to keep the crew safe.

[Warcin]: Waciej, your story doesn't add up. If you really saw me kill Warek, why didn't you report it immediately? Waiting until the discussion phase seems like a tactic to gather support and frame me. Everyone, think about it: why would I kill someone with another person in the room? It doesn't make sense. Waciej is trying too hard to push the blame on me, which is suspicious. Maybe Waciej is the impostor trying to get rid of an innocent crewmate.
