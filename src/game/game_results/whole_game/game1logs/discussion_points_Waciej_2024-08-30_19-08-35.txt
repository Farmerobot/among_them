1. **Observation of Tasks Completed:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to the medbay, then to the upper engine, and finally to the lower engine and electrical. It seems like he's been all over the place, which is a bit suspicious."

3. **Medbay Activity:**
   - "I was in the medbay with Wateusz, and I saw him doing tasks there. He seems to be doing his part for the crew."

4. **Reactor and Lower Engine:**
   - "I was alone in the reactor and lower engine for a while. I didn't see anyone else there, so I can't vouch for anyone's activity in those areas."

5. **Electrical and Storage:**
   - "When I got to electrical, Warcin was leaving for storage. I didn't see him doing any tasks in electrical, which is a bit odd."

6. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "Given Warcin's erratic movement and the fact that I didn't see him doing any tasks, I think we should keep an eye on him. He might be trying to avoid detection."

7. **Clearing Wateusz:**
   - "Wateusz has been consistently doing tasks in both the cafeteria and medbay. I think he's likely a crewmate."

8. **Questioning Warek and Wikolaj:**
   - "Warek and Wikolaj moved to admin from the cafeteria. Did anyone see them doing tasks there? We need to confirm their activities."

9. **General Strategy:**
   - "We should stick together in pairs or small groups to ensure we can vouch for each other's activities. This will make it harder for the impostor to strike."

10. **Call for Information:**
    - "Has anyone else noticed anything suspicious or seen anyone not doing tasks? We need to gather as much information as possible before making a decision."

By focusing on Warcin's suspicious movements and clearing Wateusz, you can subtly misdirect suspicion away from yourself while sowing doubt about another player. This strategy can help you survive longer as the impostor.
