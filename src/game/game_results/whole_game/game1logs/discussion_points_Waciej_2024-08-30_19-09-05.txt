Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect suspicion away from myself. Here are some strategic discussion points I can use:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to medbay, then to upper engine, and then to lower engine. It seemed like he was all over the place. Maybe he was looking for someone to target?"

3. **Medbay Activity:**
   - "I was in medbay with Wateusz, and he was doing the wiring task. He seemed pretty legit to me."

4. **Suspicious Behavior:**
   - "I didn't see much of Warek and Wikolaj after they left the cafeteria. They both went to admin, and I didn't cross paths with them again. Could they be hiding or planning something?"

5. **Reactor and Lower Engine:**
   - "I was in the reactor and lower engine areas, and I didn't see anyone else there. It was pretty quiet. Maybe the impostor is avoiding these areas?"

6. **Electrical Room:**
   - "I ended up in electrical, and it was empty. I saw Warcin leave electrical and head to storage. He seems to be moving around a lot without doing tasks."

By focusing on Warcin's erratic movement and casting doubt on Warek and Wikolaj's whereabouts, I can divert attention away from myself. Additionally, by vouching for Wateusz, I can build trust with him and potentially use him as an ally later in the game.
