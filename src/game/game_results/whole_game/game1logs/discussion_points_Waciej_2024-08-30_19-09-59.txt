Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates without drawing too much suspicion to myself. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear for now."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to medbay, then to upper engine, reactor, lower engine, electrical, and finally storage. That's a lot of movement without much task completion. It seems a bit suspicious to me."

3. **Medbay Activity:**
   - "I was in medbay with Wateusz, and I saw him doing the 'Fix wiring' task. He seemed to be genuinely working on it, so I think he's safe."

4. **Reactor and Lower Engine:**
   - "I was alone in the reactor and lower engine for a while. I didn't see anyone else there, but I did complete the 'Check catalyzer' task in the lower engine."

5. **Electrical:**
   - "I ended up in electrical, but I didn't see anyone there either. It was pretty quiet."

6. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "Given Warcin's extensive movement without much task completion, I think we should keep an eye on him. It just doesn't add up."

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and subtly clearing others, I can divert attention away from myself and potentially get a crewmate banished.
