As an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Wateusz doing tasks in the Cafeteria and Medbay. He seems pretty clear to me."
   - "Warek and Wikolaj were also doing tasks in the Cafeteria. They seemed genuine."

2. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the Cafeteria to Medbay, then to Upper Engine, Lower Engine, Reactor, Electrical, and finally Storage. That's a lot of movement without completing any tasks."
   - "Warcin's movements seem suspicious. He was in a lot of different locations but I didn't see him doing any tasks."

3. **Self-Defense:**
   - "I was mostly alone in the rooms I visited after leaving Medbay. I completed the task in Lower Engine and then moved to Electrical."
   - "I didn't see anyone else in Electrical, so I can't vouch for anyone there."

4. **General Misdirection:**
   - "We should keep an eye on those who are moving around a lot without clear tasks. It could be a sign of the impostor trying to find a target."
   - "Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. We need more information before making a decision."

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and reinforcing the idea that I was alone and completing tasks, I can divert attention away from myself and create doubt among the crewmates.
