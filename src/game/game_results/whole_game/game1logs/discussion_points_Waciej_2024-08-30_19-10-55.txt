As an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to medbay, then to upper engine, reactor, lower engine, electrical, and finally storage. That's a lot of movement without completing any tasks. It seems suspicious to me."

3. **Medbay Activity:**
   - "I was in medbay with Wateusz, and I saw him doing the 'Fix wiring' task. He seems to be doing his tasks diligently."

4. **Reactor and Lower Engine:**
   - "I was alone in the reactor and lower engine for a while. I didn't see anyone else there, which makes me wonder if someone is avoiding those areas to stay out of sight."

5. **Electrical:**
   - "I ended up in electrical and saw Warcin moving to storage from there. Electrical is a common place for impostors to sabotage, so we should keep an eye on Warcin."

6. **General Suspicion:**
   - "Given Warcin's erratic movement and the fact that he was in several key locations without completing tasks, I think we should consider him as a potential impostor."

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and providing observations that seem logical, I can steer the discussion away from myself and potentially get a crewmate banished.
