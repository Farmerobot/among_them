As an impostor, my goal is to misdirect and create confusion among the crewmates. Here are my strategic discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to medbay, then to upper engine, lower engine, reactor, electrical, and finally storage. That's a lot of movement without completing any tasks. It seems suspicious to me."

3. **Alibi for Myself:**
   - "I was in medbay with Wateusz, and I saw him complete the wiring task. I then moved to upper engine, reactor, lower engine, and finally electrical. I was alone in most of these rooms, so I didn't see much else."

4. **Questioning Warek and Wikolaj:**
   - "Warek and Wikolaj, you both moved to admin from the cafeteria. Did you see anything suspicious there? Did you complete any tasks?"

5. **Highlighting Completed Tasks:**
   - "I saw the task 'Check catalyzer in lower engine' completed when I was in lower engine. Did anyone else see this task being done?"

6. **Casting Doubt on Warcin's Movements:**
   - "Warcin, you moved from reactor to lower engine, then to electrical, and finally to storage. Can you explain what tasks you were doing? It seems like a lot of movement without much purpose."

By focusing on Warcin's movements and casting doubt on his actions, I can divert attention away from myself and create suspicion around him. Additionally, by confirming the tasks of other players, I can build trust and make myself seem more credible.
