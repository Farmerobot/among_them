Alright, as an impostor, I need to be strategic about what I reveal to avoid suspicion while subtly directing attention away from myself. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to medbay, then to upper engine, and later to lower engine and electrical. It seems like he's been all over the place, which is a bit suspicious."

3. **Medbay Activity:**
   - "I was in the medbay with Wateusz, and I saw him doing the 'Fix wiring' task. He seemed to be genuinely working on it, so I think he's safe."

4. **Reactor and Lower Engine:**
   - "I was in the reactor and lower engine areas, and I didn't see anyone else there. It was pretty quiet, which is unusual. Maybe someone is avoiding those areas?"

5. **Electrical:**
   - "I ended up in electrical and saw Warcin moving to storage from there. Electrical is a common place for impostors to sabotage, so we should keep an eye on Warcin."

6. **General Suspicion:**
   - "Given Warcin's extensive movement and the fact that he was in electrical, which is a high-risk area, I think we should consider him as a potential impostor."

By focusing on Warcin's movements and subtly clearing others, I can divert attention away from myself and sow doubt among the crewmates.
