As an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Wateusz doing tasks in the cafeteria and medbay. He seems pretty clear to me."
   - "Warek and Wikolaj were also doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed legit."

2. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to medbay, then to upper engine, lower engine, reactor, electrical, and finally storage. That's a lot of movement without completing any tasks."
   - "Warcin's movements seem suspicious. He was in the reactor and then quickly moved to lower engine and electrical. Why so much movement without any tasks being completed?"

3. **Self-Defense:**
   - "I was mostly alone in the upper engine, reactor, and lower engine. I completed the 'Check catalyzer' task in the lower engine."
   - "I didn't see anything suspicious in electrical when I was there."

4. **General Misdirection:**
   - "We should keep an eye on those who are moving around a lot without doing tasks. It could be a sign of an impostor trying to avoid detection."
   - "Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. We need more information before making a decision."

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and reinforcing the legitimacy of other players, I can divert attention away from myself and create doubt among the crewmates.
