Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Wateusz doing tasks in the cafeteria and medbay. He seems pretty clear to me."
   - "Warek and Wikolaj were also doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed genuine."

2. **Suspicious Movements:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to medbay, then to upper engine, lower engine, reactor, and finally electrical. That's a lot of movement without completing any tasks."
   - "Warcin was the only one I saw moving to electrical and then to storage. It seemed like he was trying to avoid being seen."

3. **Alibi Establishment:**
   - "I was with Wateusz in medbay for a while, and he was definitely doing tasks. I can vouch for him."
   - "I completed the task in the lower engine and then moved to electrical. I didn't see anyone else there."

4. **Casting Doubt:**
   - "Warcin's movements are really suspicious. He was in so many different locations without any clear task completions. Maybe he's trying to find someone alone?"
   - "I didn't see Warek or Wikolaj after they moved to admin. What were they doing there for so long?"

5. **General Observations:**
   - "We need to be careful and stick together. The impostor is probably trying to isolate someone."
   - "Let's keep an eye on Warcin. His movements don't add up to someone completing tasks."

By focusing on Warcin's movements and casting doubt on Warek and Wikolaj's activities in admin, I can divert attention away from myself and create suspicion among the crewmates.
