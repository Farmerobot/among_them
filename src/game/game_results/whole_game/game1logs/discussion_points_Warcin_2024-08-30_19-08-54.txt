Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to misdirect and create confusion without drawing suspicion to myself. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks."

2. **Movement Pattern:**
   - "After leaving the Cafeteria, I moved through Upper Engine, Security, Reactor, and Lower Engine. I didn't see anyone in those areas, which was a bit odd."

3. **Electrical Room:**
   - "I eventually made my way to Electrical and saw Warek there doing a task. I left shortly after and headed to Storage."

4. **Suspicion on Others:**
   - "I didn't see anyone else in the areas I passed through, which makes me wonder where everyone was. Maybe someone was hiding or venting?"

5. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Can anyone account for their whereabouts during the time I was moving through those areas? It felt like a ghost town."

6. **Deflecting Blame:**
   - "Warek was alive when I left Electrical, so whoever killed him must have come in after I left. Did anyone see anyone suspicious near Electrical?"

7. **Creating Doubt:**
   - "It's strange that so many people were in the Cafeteria at the same time. Could it be that some of them were faking tasks?"

8. **Encouraging Grouping:**
   - "We should probably stick together more to avoid getting picked off. Maybe we can pair up and watch each other's backs."

9. **Offering Help:**
   - "If anyone needs help with tasks or wants to stick together, let me know. Safety in numbers, right?"

10. **Final Push:**
    - "Let's try to figure out who was near Electrical after I left. That might give us a clue about the impostor."

By focusing on these points, I can create a narrative that keeps suspicion away from me while sowing doubt and confusion among the crewmates.
