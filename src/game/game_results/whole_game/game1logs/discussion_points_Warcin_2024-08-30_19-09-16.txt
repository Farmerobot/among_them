Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to misdirect and create confusion without drawing suspicion to myself. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation in Cafeteria**: "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks."

2. **Movement Pattern**: "After leaving the Cafeteria, I moved through Upper Engine, Security, Reactor, and Lower Engine. I didn't see anyone in those areas, which seemed a bit odd."

3. **Electrical Room**: "I eventually made my way to Electrical and saw Warek there doing a task. I left shortly after and moved to Storage."

4. **Suspicion on Others**: "I didn't see anyone else in the areas I passed through, which makes me wonder where everyone else was. Has anyone seen Wateusz, Waciej, or Wikolaj in other parts of the map?"

5. **Questioning Alibis**: "Can anyone account for their whereabouts during the last few minutes? We need to figure out who was where to narrow down the suspects."

6. **Feigning Concern**: "It's really concerning that Warek is now dead. He was doing his tasks diligently. We need to find out who was near Electrical around that time."

By focusing on these points, I can create a narrative that keeps the attention away from me while sowing seeds of doubt about the other players.
