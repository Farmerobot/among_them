As an impostor, my goal is to misdirect and create confusion among the crewmates. Here are my strategic discussion points:

1. **Observation in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks."

2. **Movement Pattern:**
   - "After leaving the Cafeteria, I moved through Upper Engine, Security, Reactor, and Lower Engine. I didn't see anyone in those areas, which seemed a bit odd."

3. **Electrical Room:**
   - "I eventually made my way to Electrical and saw Warek there doing a task. I left shortly after and headed to Storage."

4. **Suspicion on Others:**
   - "I didn't see anyone else in the areas I passed through, which makes me wonder where everyone was. Maybe someone was hiding or venting?"

5. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Wateusz, Waciej, and Wikolaj, can you confirm each other's locations after the Cafeteria? Did anyone see Warek after that?"

6. **Self-Defense:**
   - "I was mostly alone in the rooms I passed through, so I don't have much to add. But I did see Warek alive in Electrical before I left."

7. **Casting Doubt:**
   - "It's strange that Warek was the only one I saw in Electrical. Could someone have vented in and killed him after I left?"

8. **Encouraging Discussion:**
   - "We need to figure out who was where and when. Let's piece together everyone's movements to find inconsistencies."

By sharing these points, I aim to create confusion and divert suspicion away from myself while subtly casting doubt on others.
