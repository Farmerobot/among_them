Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to deflect suspicion away from myself and potentially cast doubt on others. Here are some strategic discussion points I can use:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks."

2. **Movement and Locations:**
   - "After leaving the Cafeteria, I moved through Upper Engine, Security, Reactor, and Lower Engine. I didn't see anyone in those areas, which seemed a bit odd."

3. **Electrical Room:**
   - "I eventually made my way to Electrical and saw Warek there doing a task. I left shortly after and moved to Storage."

4. **Suspicion on Others:**
   - "I didn't see anyone else in Electrical after I left, but it's a common place for kills to happen. Did anyone else see Warek after I did? Maybe someone else went in there after me."

5. **General Inquiry:**
   - "Has anyone else noticed any suspicious behavior or seen anyone acting strangely? We need to piece together everyone's movements."

6. **Self-Defense:**
   - "I was mostly moving around trying to complete my tasks and didn't see much action. If anyone has any questions about my movements, feel free to ask."

By sharing these points, I aim to blend in with the crewmates and avoid drawing suspicion to myself. Additionally, by subtly suggesting that someone else might have entered Electrical after me, I can plant seeds of doubt about other players.
