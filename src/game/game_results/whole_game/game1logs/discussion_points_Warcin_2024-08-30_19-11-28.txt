Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to deflect suspicion away from myself and potentially cast doubt on others. Here are some strategic discussion points I can use:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks."

2. **Movement Pattern:**
   - "I moved from Medbay to Upper Engine, then to Security, Reactor, Lower Engine, Electrical, and finally Storage. I didn't see anyone in most of these locations, which is a bit odd."

3. **Suspicion on Warek:**
   - "I saw Warek doing a task in Electrical, but I didn't see him after that. Has anyone seen Warek recently? He might be hiding or doing something suspicious."

4. **Questioning Others' Locations:**
   - "Where was everyone else during the last few minutes? I didn't see many people around, which makes it hard to know who might be the impostor."

5. **Feigning Concern:**
   - "I'm a bit worried that someone might be using the vents to move around quickly. I didn't see anyone in several rooms, which seems unusual."

6. **Casting Doubt on Wateusz:**
   - "Wateusz was doing a task in the Cafeteria, but I haven't seen him since. Could he be trying to avoid being seen?"

7. **General Call for Information:**
   - "We need to figure out who was where and when. If we can piece together everyone's movements, we might be able to identify the impostor."

By using these discussion points, I can create confusion and misdirection, making it harder for the crewmates to pinpoint me as the impostor.
