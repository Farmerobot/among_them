As an impostor, my goal is to misdirect and create confusion among the crewmates. Here are my strategic discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks."

2. **Movement Pattern:**
   - "I moved from Medbay to Upper Engine, then to Security, Reactor, Lower Engine, and finally Electrical. I didn't see anyone in most of these locations, which is a bit suspicious."

3. **Suspicion on Warek:**
   - "When I was in Electrical, I saw Warek doing a task. But then I left and went to Storage. I didn't see him leave Electrical, which makes me wonder if he was faking the task."

4. **Alibi Establishment:**
   - "I was alone in most of the rooms I visited, so I don't have a strong alibi. But I did see Warek in Electrical, and he was the only one I saw there."

5. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Wateusz, Waciej, and Wikolaj, can you confirm each other's tasks in the Cafeteria? Did anyone see Warek after I left Electrical?"

6. **Casting Doubt:**
   - "It's strange that I didn't see anyone else in the other rooms I visited. Could it be that someone is using the vents to move around quickly?"

7. **Deflecting Blame:**
   - "I think we should keep an eye on Warek. If he was faking tasks, he might be the impostor trying to blend in."

By focusing on Warek and creating doubt about his actions, I can divert attention away from myself and potentially get the crewmates to vote him out. Additionally, questioning others about their tasks and movements can create further confusion and mistrust among the crewmates.
