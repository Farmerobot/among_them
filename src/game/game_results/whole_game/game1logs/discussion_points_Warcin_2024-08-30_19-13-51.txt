Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to misdirect and create confusion among the crewmates. Here are some strategic discussion points I can use:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks."

2. **Movement and Alibis:**
   - "I spent some time moving around the ship. I was in Medbay, Upper Engine, Security, Reactor, and Lower Engine, but I didn't see anyone else in those areas. It was pretty quiet."

3. **Suspicion on Others:**
   - "I noticed Warek was in Electrical when I passed through, but I didn't see him leave. Maybe someone should check there to see if he's still around or if something happened."

4. **Self-Alibi:**
   - "I was in Storage after moving through Electrical, and I didn't see anyone else there either. It seems like everyone is spread out."

5. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Has anyone seen Wateusz, Waciej, or Wikolaj recently? They were all in the Cafeteria earlier, but I haven't seen them since."

6. **Feigning Concern:**
   - "We need to be careful and stick together. If anyone has seen anything suspicious, now's the time to speak up."

By using these points, I can create a narrative that keeps suspicion away from me and potentially directs it towards others. The key is to blend in and appear as a concerned crewmate while subtly sowing doubt and confusion.
