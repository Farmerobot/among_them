Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to misdirect and create confusion among the crewmates. Here are some strategic discussion points I can share:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier. They seemed pretty focused, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Movement Pattern:**
   - "I moved from Medbay to Upper Engine, then to Security, Reactor, Lower Engine, and finally Electrical. I didn't see anyone suspicious during my rounds."

3. **Suspicion on Others:**
   - "I didn't see Wateusz or Waciej after the Cafeteria. They might have gone off to do tasks, but it's also possible they could have been up to something else."

4. **Alibi for Electrical:**
   - "When I was in Electrical, I saw Warek doing a task. I left shortly after, so I didn't see anything unusual there."

5. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Has anyone seen anything suspicious? Any odd movements or people not doing tasks?"

6. **Deflecting Blame:**
   - "I think we should keep an eye on Wateusz and Waciej. They were the last ones I saw in the Cafeteria, and I haven't seen them since."

By focusing on these points, I can create a narrative that keeps suspicion away from me and potentially directs it towards other players.
