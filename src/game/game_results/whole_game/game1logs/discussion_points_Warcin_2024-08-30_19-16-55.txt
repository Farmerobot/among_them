Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to misdirect and create confusion among the crewmates. Here are some strategic discussion points I can use:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I moved from Medbay to Upper Engine, then to Security, Reactor, Lower Engine, and finally Electrical. I didn't see anyone suspicious during my rounds."

3. **Alibi for Electrical:**
   - "When I was in Electrical, I saw Warek doing a task. He seemed to be working on it for a while, so I don't think he was faking it."

4. **Suspicion on Others:**
   - "I didn't see Wateusz, Waciej, or Wikolaj much after the Cafeteria. Does anyone know where they were? They might have had the opportunity to do something suspicious."

5. **Feigning Ignorance:**
   - "I didn't see anyone else in Storage or Medbay. Has anyone else been to those locations recently?"

6. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Wateusz, Waciej, and Wikolaj, can you account for your movements after the Cafeteria? We need to narrow down who might have had the chance to do something suspicious."

7. **Expressing Concern:**
   - "We need to be careful with our votes. We don't have much information, and we can't afford to lose another crewmate."

By focusing on these points, I can create a narrative that keeps suspicion away from me while subtly casting doubt on others. The key is to blend in and appear as a concerned crewmate while steering the conversation away from my actions.
