1. **Observation of Tasks Completed:**
   - "I saw Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the cafeteria. It seems like they were all busy with their tasks, which makes me think they might be clear."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moved from the cafeteria to the medbay, and then to the upper engine. It seemed like a logical path for someone completing tasks."

3. **Medbay Activity:**
   - "I was in the medbay with Waciej, and I saw him complete the 'Run diagnostics' task. He then moved to the upper engine, which aligns with someone following their task list."

4. **Upper Engine and Reactor:**
   - "After Waciej left the upper engine, I completed the 'Check catalyzer' task there. I then moved to the reactor, but didn't see anyone there."

5. **Suspicious Movement:**
   - "I saw Waciej move from the lower engine to electrical. It seemed a bit odd since I didn't see him doing any tasks in the lower engine. Maybe he was just passing through, but it's worth noting."

6. **Alibi Establishment:**
   - "I've been moving around a lot, completing tasks in various locations. I was in the medbay, upper engine, reactor, and lower engine. If anyone saw me, they can confirm my movements."

7. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Warek and Wikolaj, you both moved to admin from the cafeteria. Did you see each other there? What tasks were you working on?"

8. **Casting Doubt:**
   - "Warcin, you moved from the medbay to the upper engine and then disappeared. What tasks were you working on? Can anyone vouch for your movements?"

By sharing these points, you can create a narrative that positions you as a diligent crewmate while subtly casting doubt on others. This can help you avoid suspicion and potentially direct attention towards other players.
