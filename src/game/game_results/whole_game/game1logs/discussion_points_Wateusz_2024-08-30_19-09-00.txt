Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Task Completion in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Movement Observations:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving from the cafeteria to the medbay and then to the upper engine. He was moving around a lot, which seemed a bit suspicious to me. Maybe he was trying to avoid being seen?"

3. **Medbay Activity:**
   - "I was in the medbay with Waciej, and I saw him doing the diagnostics task. It took a while, but he completed it. So, I think Waciej is safe."

4. **Upper Engine and Reactor:**
   - "I moved to the upper engine and completed the catalyzer task there. I didn't see anyone else around at that time."

5. **Lower Engine and Electrical:**
   - "When I was in the lower engine, I saw Waciej moving to electrical. He was moving around a lot, which could be a sign of him trying to find someone alone."

6. **General Suspicion:**
   - "Overall, I think Warcin's movements were the most suspicious. He was moving between locations without doing any visible tasks. Maybe we should keep an eye on him?"

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and subtly clearing Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj, I can create a narrative that keeps the heat off me while sowing doubt among the crewmates.
