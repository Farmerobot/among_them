Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."
   - "I also saw Waciej doing the diagnostics task in the medbay, and it got completed. So, Waciej might be safe."

2. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to the medbay, then to the upper engine. It seemed like he was avoiding tasks. Has anyone seen Warcin actually doing any tasks?"

3. **Self-Defense:**
   - "I was mostly in the medbay and upper engine, completing my tasks. I didn't see anything suspicious there."

4. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Warek and Wikolaj, you both moved to the admin from the cafeteria. Did you see anything suspicious there?"
   - "Waciej, you moved to the reactor from the upper engine. Did you notice anything odd?"

5. **General Misdirection:**
   - "It's strange that we haven't found any bodies yet. Maybe the impostor is trying to blend in by doing tasks or moving around a lot."

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and asking questions to others, I can divert attention away from myself and create doubt among the crewmates.
