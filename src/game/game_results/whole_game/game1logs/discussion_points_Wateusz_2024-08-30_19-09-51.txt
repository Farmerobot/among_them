Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."
   - "I also saw Waciej doing the 'Run diagnostics' task in the medbay, and it got completed. So, Waciej might be safe."

2. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to the medbay, then to the upper engine. It seemed like he was just wandering around without doing any tasks. That seems suspicious to me."

3. **Self-Defense:**
   - "I was mostly in the medbay and upper engine, completing my tasks. I finished 'Check catalyzer' in the upper engine and then moved to the reactor and lower engine. I didn't see anyone else around those areas."

4. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Warek and Wikolaj, you both moved to the admin from the cafeteria. What tasks were you doing there? Did anyone see them doing tasks in the admin?"

5. **Casting Doubt:**
   - "It's strange that Warcin moved from the medbay to the upper engine without doing any tasks in between. Maybe he was looking for an opportunity to sabotage or eliminate someone."

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and subtly clearing others, I can divert attention away from myself and create doubt among the crewmates.
