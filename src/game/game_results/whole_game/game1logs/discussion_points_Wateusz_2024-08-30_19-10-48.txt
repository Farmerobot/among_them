Alright, as an impostor, I need to be strategic about what I reveal. I should aim to sow doubt and confusion among the crewmates while keeping myself above suspicion. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."
   - "I also saw Waciej doing the 'Run diagnostics' task in the medbay, and it completed while I was there. So, Waciej seems to be doing tasks."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving from the cafeteria to the medbay and then to the upper engine. It seemed like a lot of movement without much task completion. Has anyone seen Warcin doing any tasks?"
   - "I saw Warek and Wikolaj move to the admin from the cafeteria. Did anyone see them doing tasks there?"

3. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "Warcin's movements seem a bit suspicious to me. He moved from the medbay to the upper engine and then disappeared. I didn't see him doing any tasks. What do you guys think?"

4. **Self-Defense:**
   - "I've been trying to complete my tasks as well. I finished 'Check catalyzer' in the upper engine and then moved around to see if I could catch anyone acting suspicious."

5. **General Inquiry:**
   - "Has anyone seen anything unusual or anyone acting suspicious? We need to narrow down our suspects."

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and reinforcing the idea that I saw others doing tasks, I can divert attention away from myself and potentially get a crewmate banished.
