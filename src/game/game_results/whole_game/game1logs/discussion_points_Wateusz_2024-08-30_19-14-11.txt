Alright, as an impostor, I need to be strategic about what I reveal and how I frame the discussion. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Waciej doing tasks in the cafeteria and medbay. He seemed pretty focused on completing them."
   - "Warek and Wikolaj were also doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed legit."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving from the cafeteria to medbay and then to upper engine. He was moving around a lot, which seemed a bit suspicious to me."
   - "Waciej moved from the cafeteria to medbay, then to upper engine, and finally to electrical. He was all over the place, but he was doing tasks."

3. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "Warcin's movements were a bit erratic. He went from medbay to upper engine pretty quickly. Maybe he was trying to avoid being seen?"

4. **Self-Defense:**
   - "I was mostly in the medbay and upper engine areas, completing my tasks. I didn't see anything too suspicious there."

5. **General Observation:**
   - "It seems like everyone was pretty spread out. We need to keep an eye on those who are moving around a lot without clear tasks."

By focusing on Warcin's movements and subtly suggesting that he might be trying to avoid detection, I can divert suspicion away from myself. Additionally, by confirming the tasks of others, I can build trust and make it seem like I'm genuinely trying to help the crew.
