Alright, as an impostor, I need to be strategic about what I reveal and how I frame the discussion. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Waciej doing tasks in the cafeteria and medbay. He seemed pretty consistent with his movements and tasks."
   - "Warek and Wikolaj were also doing tasks in the cafeteria. They both moved to admin afterward."

2. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving around a lot. He went from the cafeteria to medbay, then to upper engine. It seemed like he was avoiding tasks."
   - "I didn't see Warcin doing any tasks. He was just moving between locations."

3. **My Own Movements:**
   - "I completed the task to check the catalyzer in the upper engine and then moved to the reactor and lower engine. I didn't see anyone else in those areas."

4. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Waciej, you were in electrical last. Did you see anyone else there or notice anything suspicious?"
   - "Warek and Wikolaj, what tasks did you complete in admin?"

5. **General Strategy:**
   - "We need to be careful and stick together. If anyone sees something suspicious, report it immediately."

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and asking questions to others, I can divert attention away from myself and create doubt among the crewmates.
