1. **Observation of Tasks Completed:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Warek all doing tasks in the cafeteria. The task 'Start the coffee maker' was completed, so I think they are likely safe."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed that Warcin moved from the cafeteria to the medbay. I didn't see him do any tasks, so I'm a bit suspicious of him."
   - "Wateusz and Waciej also moved to the medbay from the cafeteria. I saw Wateusz later move to the upper engine, but I didn't see Waciej after that."

3. **Alibi Establishment:**
   - "I was in the admin room with Warek, and I saw him move to storage after completing the task 'Clean the floor in admin.' He seems to be doing tasks, so he might be safe."

4. **Suspicion on Unseen Players:**
   - "I didn't see much of Warcin after he moved to the medbay. Can anyone confirm his whereabouts or if he completed any tasks?"

5. **Self-Defense:**
   - "I was in the medbay completing the 'Fix wiring' task and then 'Run diagnostics.' I was alone most of the time, so I don't have anyone to vouch for me, but I was definitely doing tasks."

6. **General Inquiry:**
   - "Has anyone seen any suspicious behavior or found any bodies? We need to gather as much information as possible."

By focusing on these points, you can create a narrative that positions you as a helpful crewmate while subtly casting doubt on others, particularly Warcin, who you didn't see doing any tasks. This strategy can help you avoid suspicion and potentially lead the crew to vote out an innocent player, giving you an advantage as the impostor.
