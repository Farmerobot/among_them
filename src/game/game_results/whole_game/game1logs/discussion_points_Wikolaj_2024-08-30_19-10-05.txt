Alright, as an impostor, I need to be strategic about what I reveal to avoid suspicion while subtly directing attention away from myself. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Warek all doing tasks in the cafeteria. The coffee maker task was completed, so they seem to be clear for now."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moved from the cafeteria to the medbay. Did anyone see him doing any tasks there?"
   - "I saw Wateusz and Waciej move from the cafeteria to the medbay as well. Did anyone see them complete any tasks in the medbay?"

3. **Suspicion on Warek:**
   - "I was in admin with Warek, and he moved to storage. I didn't see him complete any tasks in admin. Can anyone confirm if he did any tasks in storage?"

4. **My Own Movements:**
   - "I moved from the cafeteria to admin, then back to the cafeteria, and finally to the medbay. I completed the wiring task and the diagnostics task in the medbay."

5. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Wateusz, you moved to the upper engine from the medbay. What task were you doing there?"
   - "Waciej, what tasks did you complete in the medbay?"

By sharing these points, I aim to appear helpful and observant while subtly casting doubt on Warek and Warcin. This should help divert attention away from myself and potentially lead to one of them being banished.
