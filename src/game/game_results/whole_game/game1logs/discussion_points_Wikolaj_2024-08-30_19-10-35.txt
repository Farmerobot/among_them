Alright, as an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates. Here are some discussion points I can use:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Warek all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Suspicion on Movement:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moving from the cafeteria to the medbay. I didn't see him do any tasks in the cafeteria, which seems a bit suspicious to me. What was he doing in the medbay?"

3. **Alibi for Myself:**
   - "I was in the admin room cleaning the floor, and I saw Warek move to storage. After that, I went to the cafeteria and then to the medbay to fix the wiring and run diagnostics. I didn't see anyone else in the medbay, so I was alone for a while."

4. **Questioning Others:**
   - "Wateusz, I saw you move from the medbay to the upper engine. What task were you doing in the medbay? And did you see anyone else there?"

5. **Casting Doubt:**
   - "It's strange that I didn't see anyone else in the medbay while I was there. Could it be that someone is trying to avoid being seen?"

6. **General Observation:**
   - "It seems like everyone was pretty spread out. We need to be careful and keep an eye on each other. Does anyone have any strong suspicions or saw something unusual?"

By focusing on these points, I can create a narrative that casts doubt on Warcin and subtly shifts attention away from myself. Additionally, by asking questions and making observations, I can appear helpful and engaged, which might make others less likely to suspect me.
