As an impostor, my goal is to create confusion and misdirect the crewmates. Here are some strategic discussion points I can share:

1. **Observation of Tasks:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Warek all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed pretty focused on their tasks, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moved to the medbay from the cafeteria, but I didn't see him doing any tasks there. Has anyone seen Warcin complete any tasks?"

3. **Questioning Movements:**
   - "I saw Wateusz move to the medbay and then to the upper engine. Did anyone see him doing tasks in those locations? It seems like a lot of movement without much task completion."

4. **Alibi for Myself:**
   - "I was in the admin room cleaning the floor, and I saw Warek move to storage. After that, I went to the cafeteria and then to the medbay to fix wiring and run diagnostics. I was alone most of the time, so I didn't see much else."

5. **Casting Doubt:**
   - "It's strange that I didn't see anyone else in the medbay when I was there. If someone claims they were in the medbay, we should double-check their story."

6. **Encouraging Discussion:**
   - "We need to hear from everyone about their tasks and movements. Let's piece together who was where and when to figure out who might be lying."

By sharing these points, I can create a narrative that casts doubt on Warcin and possibly Wateusz, while also providing an alibi for myself. This should help divert suspicion away from me and towards other players.
