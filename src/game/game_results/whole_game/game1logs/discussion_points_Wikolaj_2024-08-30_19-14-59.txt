Alright, as an impostor, I need to be strategic about what I reveal to avoid suspicion. Here are my discussion points:

1. **Observation of Tasks in Cafeteria:**
   - "I saw Wateusz, Waciej, and Warek all doing tasks in the cafeteria. They seemed to be genuinely working on tasks, so I think they might be clear."

2. **Movement Patterns:**
   - "I noticed Warcin moved from the cafeteria to the medbay. I didn't see him doing any tasks, which seems a bit suspicious to me. What was he doing in the medbay?"

3. **My Own Movements:**
   - "I moved from the cafeteria to admin and then to the medbay. I was alone in the medbay and completed the 'Fix wiring' and 'Run diagnostics' tasks there."

4. **Suspicion on Warcin:**
   - "Warcin's movements are a bit odd. He moved to the medbay but I didn't see him doing any tasks there. Can anyone vouch for him?"

5. **Clearing Others:**
   - "Warek moved from admin to storage after completing a task in admin. He seems to be doing his tasks diligently."

By focusing suspicion on Warcin and clearing others, I can divert attention away from myself and potentially get a crewmate banished.
