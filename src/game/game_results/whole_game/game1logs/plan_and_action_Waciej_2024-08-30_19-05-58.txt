Plan:
Based on the current tasks and the observations so far, here is a step-by-step plan to accomplish the tasks efficiently:

### Plan:

1. **Move to Lower Engine:**
   - **Reason:** You have a task to "Check catalyzer in lower engine," and it is the closest task location from your current position in the Reactor.

2. **Complete Task: Check catalyzer in lower engine.**

3. **Move to Shields:**
   - **Reason:** You have a task to "Fix wiring in shields," and it is the next closest task location from Lower Engine.

4. **Complete Task: Fix wiring in shields.**

5. **Move to Weapons:**
   - **Reason:** You have two tasks in Weapons: "Fix wiring in weapons" and "Calibrate targeting system in weapons." This will allow you to complete two tasks in one location.

6. **Complete Task: Fix wiring in weapons.**

7. **Complete Task: Calibrate targeting system in weapons.**

8. **Move to Navigation:**
   - **Reason:** You have two tasks in Navigation: "Adjust course in navigation" and "Fix wiring in navigation." This will allow you to complete two tasks in one location.

9. **Complete Task: Adjust course in navigation.**

10. **Complete Task: Fix wiring in navigation.**

11. **Move to Communications:**
    - **Reason:** You have a task to "Process data in communications," and it is the next closest task location from Navigation.

12. **Complete Task: Process data in communications.**

13. **Move to Shields:**
    - **Reason:** You have a task to "Prime shields," and it is the next closest task location from Communications.

14. **Complete Task: Prime shields.**

### Summary of Steps:
1. Move to Lower Engine.
2. Complete "Check catalyzer in lower engine."
3. Move to Shields.
4. Complete "Fix wiring in shields."
5. Move to Weapons.
6. Complete "Fix wiring in weapons."
7. Complete "Calibrate targeting system in weapons."
8. Move to Navigation.
9. Complete "Adjust course in navigation."
10. Complete "Fix wiring in navigation."
11. Move to Communications.
12. Complete "Process data in communications."
13. Move to Shields.
14. Complete "Prime shields."

By following this plan, you will efficiently complete all your tasks while minimizing unnecessary movement across the map.
