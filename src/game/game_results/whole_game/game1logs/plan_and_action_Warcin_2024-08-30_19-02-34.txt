Plan:

1. **Assess the Situation:**
   - You are currently in the Cafeteria.
   - Your goal is to kill or banish all crewmates.
   - You have four immediate actions: wait in the Cafeteria, move to Medbay, move to Admin, or move to Weapons.

2. **Initial Movement:**
   - **Move to Medbay (Action 1):** Medbay is a strategic location because it is often less crowded, making it easier to find isolated crewmates. Additionally, it has a vent that can be used for quick escapes or surprise attacks.

3. **Evaluate Medbay:**
   - Once in Medbay, assess if there are any crewmates present.
   - If a crewmate is present and isolated, **kill the crewmate**.
   - If no crewmates are present, use the vent to move to another location quickly.

4. **Use Vents for Mobility:**
   - From Medbay, you can vent to Security or Electrical.
   - **Vent to Security:** Security is another strategic location as it often has fewer people and provides access to cameras, which you can sabotage to limit crewmate vision.
   - **Vent to Electrical:** Electrical is a high-traffic area but also a common kill spot due to its isolated nature and frequent tasks.

5. **Create Chaos:**
   - **Sabotage Lights or Reactor:** Sabotaging lights (in Electrical) or the reactor can create chaos and force crewmates to move to specific locations, making it easier to isolate and kill them.
   - If you vent to Electrical, sabotage the lights and wait for crewmates to come to fix them. Kill any isolated crewmates who arrive.

6. **Continue Moving and Sabotaging:**
   - After a kill, use vents to move to another location quickly to avoid suspicion.
   - Continue to sabotage critical systems (O2, Reactor, Lights) to create opportunities for kills and to split up the crewmates.

7. **Blend In:**
   - Occasionally, perform tasks or pretend to perform tasks to avoid suspicion.
   - If a meeting is called, use the information gathered to deflect suspicion onto other crewmates.

8. **Final Push:**
   - As the number of crewmates dwindles, focus on high-traffic areas like Admin and Cafeteria to catch isolated crewmates.
   - Use sabotage to force crewmates into vulnerable positions and finish them off.

By following this plan, you can strategically move through the map, create opportunities for kills, and avoid suspicion, ultimately achieving your goal of eliminating all crewmates.
