Plan:

1. **Assess the Situation:**
   - You are currently alone in the Medbay.
   - You have observed four crewmates (Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, and Wikolaj) doing tasks in the Cafeteria.
   - Your goal is to kill or banish all crewmates.

2. **Immediate Action:**
   - Since you are alone in the Medbay, it is a good opportunity to move to a location where you can encounter a crewmate alone. Moving to the Upper Engine might be a good choice as it is less likely to be crowded compared to the Cafeteria.

3. **Move to Upper Engine:**
   - Action: Move to location GameLocation.LOC_UPPER_ENGINE.

4. **Evaluate the Situation in Upper Engine:**
   - Once you arrive in the Upper Engine, assess if there are any crewmates present.
   - If you find a crewmate alone, consider killing them if it is safe to do so without being seen.
   - If the area is clear or if there are multiple crewmates, proceed to the next step.

5. **Move Strategically:**
   - If the Upper Engine is clear or not suitable for a kill, move to another location where you might find a crewmate alone. The next logical step would be to move towards the Security or Reactor area, as these are often less crowded.

6. **Continue Surveillance:**
   - Keep moving between rooms and observe the crewmates' movements.
   - Look for opportunities to isolate and kill crewmates without being seen.
   - Use vents if necessary to quickly move between locations and avoid detection.

7. **Create Alibis:**
   - If you encounter other crewmates, act as if you are doing tasks to avoid suspicion.
   - Blend in with the group when necessary and avoid being seen near dead bodies.

8. **Execute Kills:**
   - When you find a crewmate alone, kill them and quickly move to another location to avoid being caught.
   - Use sabotage (e.g., turning off lights, causing reactor meltdown) to create chaos and separate crewmates, making it easier to isolate and kill them.

9. **Repeat the Process:**
   - Continue moving strategically, observing crewmates, and executing kills until all crewmates are eliminated or banished.

10. **Final Steps:**
   - As the number of crewmates decreases, be more cautious and strategic in your movements.
   - Ensure you are not seen near the bodies and maintain your alibi.
   - Use emergency meetings to your advantage by accusing others or deflecting suspicion away from yourself.

By following this step-by-step plan, you can systematically eliminate the crewmates and achieve your goal of killing or banishing all crewmates.
