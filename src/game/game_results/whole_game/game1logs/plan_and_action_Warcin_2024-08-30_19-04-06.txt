Plan:

1. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_SECURITY**:
   - **Reason**: Security is a strategic location where you can monitor other players' movements through the security cameras. This will help you gather information on the whereabouts of crewmates and plan your next move accordingly.

2. **Observe the security cameras**:
   - **Reason**: By observing the cameras, you can identify isolated crewmates or potential targets. This will also help you avoid being seen by other crewmates, reducing the risk of being caught.

3. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_REACTOR**:
   - **Reason**: The Reactor is a common location for crewmates to perform tasks. Moving here increases the chances of encountering a crewmate alone, providing an opportunity to kill.

4. **Kill any isolated crewmate in GameLocation.LOC_REACTOR**:
   - **Reason**: Eliminating a crewmate in a less frequented area like the Reactor reduces the chances of the body being discovered quickly.

5. **Sabotage the Reactor or O2**:
   - **Reason**: Sabotaging critical systems forces crewmates to move towards those locations, creating chaos and providing opportunities for further kills or to blend in with the group.

6. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL**:
   - **Reason**: Electrical is another high-traffic area where crewmates often perform tasks. It also has multiple entry points, making it easier to escape after a kill.

7. **Kill any isolated crewmate in GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL**:
   - **Reason**: Similar to the Reactor, killing in Electrical can be advantageous due to its layout and the likelihood of finding crewmates alone.

8. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE**:
   - **Reason**: Storage is centrally located, allowing for quick movement to other parts of the map. It also provides opportunities to encounter crewmates moving between tasks.

9. **Monitor crewmate movements and adapt**:
   - **Reason**: Continuously adapt your strategy based on the movements and actions of the crewmates. Use vents if necessary to move quickly and avoid detection.

10. **Repeat the process of isolating and killing crewmates**:
    - **Reason**: Continue to isolate and eliminate crewmates while avoiding detection. Use sabotage strategically to create opportunities and disrupt crewmate coordination.

By following this plan, you can systematically eliminate crewmates while minimizing the risk of being caught. Remember to stay vigilant and adapt your strategy based on the evolving game state.
