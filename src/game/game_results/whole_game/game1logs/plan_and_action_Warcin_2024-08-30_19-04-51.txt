Plan:

1. **Assess the Situation:**
   - You are currently in GameLocation.LOC_SECURITY and alone.
   - You have observed multiple crewmates (Wateusz, Waciej, Warek, Wikolaj) doing tasks in GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA.
   - Your goal is to kill or banish all crewmates.

2. **Strategic Movement:**
   - Since you are alone in GameLocation.LOC_SECURITY, you have the opportunity to move without being seen.
   - Moving to high-traffic areas or areas where you can find isolated crewmates is crucial.

3. **Step-by-Step Approach:**

   **Step 1: Move to GameLocation.LOC_REACTOR**
   - Reason: The reactor is a critical area where crewmates often go to fix emergencies. It is also somewhat isolated, making it a good place to find a lone crewmate.

   **Step 2: Assess the Situation in GameLocation.LOC_REACTOR**
   - If you find a crewmate alone, kill them.
   - If the area is empty, proceed to the next step.

   **Step 3: Move to GameLocation.LOC_LOWER_ENGINE**
   - Reason: The lower engine is another area that is somewhat isolated and can be a good place to find a lone crewmate.

   **Step 4: Assess the Situation in GameLocation.LOC_LOWER_ENGINE**
   - If you find a crewmate alone, kill them.
   - If the area is empty, proceed to the next step.

   **Step 5: Move to GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL**
   - Reason: Electrical is a common area for crewmates to do tasks and is often a good place to find isolated crewmates.

   **Step 6: Assess the Situation in GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL**
   - If you find a crewmate alone, kill them.
   - If the area is empty, proceed to the next step.

   **Step 7: Move to GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE**
   - Reason: Storage is a central area that connects to many other locations. It is a good place to move through to find crewmates.

   **Step 8: Assess the Situation in GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE**
   - If you find a crewmate alone, kill them.
   - If the area is empty, proceed to the next step.

   **Step 9: Move to GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN**
   - Reason: Admin is a high-traffic area where crewmates often go to check the map and do tasks.

   **Step 10: Assess the Situation in GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN**
   - If you find a crewmate alone, kill them.
   - If the area is empty, proceed to the next step.

4. **Repeat the Process:**
   - Continue moving through the map, focusing on high-traffic and isolated areas.
   - Always be ready to kill a crewmate if you find them alone.
   - Avoid being seen by multiple crewmates to prevent suspicion.

5. **Emergency Sabotage:**
   - Use sabotage strategically to create opportunities to isolate and kill crewmates.
   - For example, sabotage the lights to reduce visibility or create a reactor meltdown to force crewmates to move to specific locations.

By following this plan, you can systematically move through the map, find isolated crewmates, and accomplish your goal of killing or banishing all crewmates.
