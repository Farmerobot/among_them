Plan:

1. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_LOWER_ENGINE**:
   - Reason: This location is closer to other high-traffic areas like Electrical and Storage, where crewmates are likely to be found.

2. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL**:
   - Reason: Electrical is a common location for crewmates to perform tasks. It is also a good place to find isolated crewmates.

3. **Observe and Act**:
   - If you find a crewmate alone in Electrical, kill them.
   - If there are multiple crewmates, wait and observe their movements. 

4. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE**:
   - Reason: Storage is another high-traffic area where crewmates often pass through. It also provides access to multiple other locations.

5. **Observe and Act**:
   - If you find a crewmate alone in Storage, kill them.
   - If there are multiple crewmates, wait and observe their movements.

6. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN**:
   - Reason: Admin is a strategic location to monitor crewmate movements using the Admin table. It also provides access to other important locations like Cafeteria and Communications.

7. **Use Admin Table**:
   - Check the Admin table to see where crewmates are located. This will help you plan your next move more effectively.

8. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA**:
   - Reason: Cafeteria is a central location that provides access to multiple other areas. It is also a good place to find isolated crewmates.

9. **Observe and Act**:
   - If you find a crewmate alone in Cafeteria, kill them.
   - If there are multiple crewmates, wait and observe their movements.

10. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_WEAPONS**:
    - Reason: Weapons is another location where crewmates perform tasks. It also provides access to O2 and Navigation.

11. **Observe and Act**:
    - If you find a crewmate alone in Weapons, kill them.
    - If there are multiple crewmates, wait and observe their movements.

12. **Repeat the Cycle**:
    - Continue moving between high-traffic areas (Electrical, Storage, Admin, Cafeteria, Weapons) and look for opportunities to kill isolated crewmates.
    - Use vents if available to quickly move between locations and avoid detection.

13. **Sabotage**:
    - Use sabotage to create chaos and separate crewmates. For example, sabotage lights to make it easier to kill crewmates in the dark.
    - Sabotage reactors or O2 to force crewmates to move to specific locations, making it easier to find isolated targets.

14. **Final Steps**:
    - As the number of crewmates decreases, be more cautious and strategic in your movements.
    - Use vents and sabotage to your advantage to avoid detection and create opportunities for kills.
    - Ensure that you are not seen near the bodies to avoid suspicion.

By following this plan, you can systematically eliminate crewmates while minimizing the risk of being caught.
