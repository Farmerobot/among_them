Plan:

1. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL**:
   - Reason: Electrical is a common location where crewmates perform tasks, making it a potential spot to find and eliminate a crewmate.

2. **Observe and Act in GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL**:
   - If a crewmate is present, eliminate them if the coast is clear.
   - If no crewmate is present, wait for a short period to see if anyone arrives.

3. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE**:
   - Reason: Storage is a central location that connects to multiple rooms, increasing the chances of encountering a crewmate.

4. **Observe and Act in GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE**:
   - If a crewmate is present, eliminate them if the coast is clear.
   - If no crewmate is present, wait for a short period to see if anyone arrives.

5. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN**:
   - Reason: Admin is another high-traffic area where crewmates often go to check the map or perform tasks.

6. **Observe and Act in GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN**:
   - If a crewmate is present, eliminate them if the coast is clear.
   - If no crewmate is present, wait for a short period to see if anyone arrives.

7. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA**:
   - Reason: Cafeteria is a central hub and a common meeting place for crewmates.

8. **Observe and Act in GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA**:
   - If a crewmate is present, eliminate them if the coast is clear.
   - If no crewmate is present, wait for a short period to see if anyone arrives.

9. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY**:
   - Reason: Medbay is a location where crewmates perform tasks, and it is also a good place to hide after an elimination.

10. **Observe and Act in GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY**:
    - If a crewmate is present, eliminate them if the coast is clear.
    - If no crewmate is present, wait for a short period to see if anyone arrives.

11. **Repeat the Cycle**:
    - Continue moving between high-traffic areas (Electrical, Storage, Admin, Cafeteria, Medbay) to maximize the chances of encountering and eliminating crewmates.

12. **Use Sabotage Wisely**:
    - Use sabotage to create opportunities for eliminations or to divert crewmates to specific locations where you can ambush them.

By following this plan, you can systematically move through the map, increasing your chances of encountering and eliminating crewmates while minimizing the risk of being caught.
