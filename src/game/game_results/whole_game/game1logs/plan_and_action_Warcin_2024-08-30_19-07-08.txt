Plan:

1. **Kill Warek in Electrical:**
   - Since you are alone with Warek in Electrical, this is an opportune moment to eliminate a crewmate without witnesses.
   - **Action:** Kill Warek.

2. **Move to Storage:**
   - After killing Warek, you need to leave the scene quickly to avoid suspicion.
   - **Action:** Move to GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE.

3. **Sabotage:**
   - To create confusion and divert attention from the body in Electrical, initiate a sabotage. This could be a reactor meltdown, O2 depletion, or lights out.
   - **Action:** Sabotage (choose an appropriate sabotage based on the situation).

4. **Blend In:**
   - Move to a location where you can blend in with other crewmates and act as if you are performing tasks or responding to the sabotage.
   - **Action:** Move to a location with other players (e.g., Cafeteria, Admin, or wherever the sabotage requires attention).

5. **Monitor Crewmates:**
   - Keep an eye on the crewmates' movements and try to stay in groups to avoid suspicion.
   - **Action:** Observe and gather information on crewmates' locations and activities.

6. **Create Alibis:**
   - Engage in conversations and provide alibis if a meeting is called. Mention your presence in locations with other crewmates to build trust.
   - **Action:** Participate in discussions and provide plausible alibis.

7. **Repeat the Process:**
   - Once the situation calms down, look for another opportunity to isolate and eliminate another crewmate.
   - **Action:** Repeat steps 1-6 as necessary until all crewmates are eliminated or banished.

By following this plan, you can systematically eliminate crewmates while minimizing suspicion and maintaining your cover as an impostor.
