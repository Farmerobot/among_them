Plan:

1. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE**:
   - Rationale: Moving to Storage will help you distance yourself from the crime scene. This will reduce the likelihood of being suspected if someone finds Warek's body in Electrical.

2. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN**:
   - Rationale: Admin is a central location that allows you to monitor player movements using the Admin table. This can help you plan your next moves and identify isolated crewmates.

3. **Observe the Admin Table**:
   - Rationale: Use the Admin table to see where other players are located. Look for isolated players or groups of players to determine your next target.

4. **Move to an Isolated Location with a Crewmate**:
   - Rationale: Based on the information from the Admin table, move to a location where a crewmate is alone. This will give you an opportunity to kill another crewmate without being seen.

5. **Kill the Isolated Crewmate**:
   - Rationale: Continue to reduce the number of crewmates by killing the isolated player. Ensure that you are not seen by other players.

6. **Move to a Different Location**:
   - Rationale: After the kill, move to a different location to avoid suspicion. Choose a location that is not directly connected to the crime scene to create an alibi.

7. **Blend in with Other Players**:
   - Rationale: Spend some time in common areas with other players to avoid suspicion. Participate in discussions and try to deflect blame onto other players.

8. **Repeat Steps 3-7**:
   - Rationale: Continue using the Admin table to find isolated players and kill them. Move strategically to avoid suspicion and blend in with the group.

9. **Sabotage Critical Systems**:
   - Rationale: Use sabotages like Reactor Meltdown or Oxygen Depletion to create chaos and split up the crewmates. This will make it easier to isolate and kill them.

10. **Final Kill**:
    - Rationale: Once the number of crewmates is low enough, make the final kill to win the game. Ensure that you are not seen by the remaining players.

By following this plan, you can systematically eliminate the crewmates while minimizing the risk of being caught.
