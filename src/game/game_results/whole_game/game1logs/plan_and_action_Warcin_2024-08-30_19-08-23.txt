Plan:
### Plan:

1. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN**:
   - **Reason**: Admin is a high-traffic area where you can gather information about other players' locations using the Admin table. This will help you plan your next moves and potential kills.

2. **Observe and Gather Information**:
   - **Action**: Wait in Admin and use the Admin table to see where other players are located.
   - **Reason**: This will help you identify isolated players or groups, making it easier to plan your next kill or create an alibi.

3. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_COMMUNICATIONS**:
   - **Reason**: Communications is often less crowded, and you might find an isolated player there. Additionally, sabotaging communications can disrupt crewmates' ability to complete tasks and communicate.

4. **Sabotage Communications**:
   - **Action**: Sabotage the communications system.
   - **Reason**: This will create chaos and force crewmates to come to Communications to fix it, giving you an opportunity to kill or blend in.

5. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_SHIELDS**:
   - **Reason**: Shields is another location where you might find an isolated player. It's also a good place to hide after a kill in Communications.

6. **Kill Any Isolated Crewmate**:
   - **Action**: If you find an isolated crewmate in Shields, kill them.
   - **Reason**: This will further reduce the number of crewmates and bring you closer to your goal.

7. **Move to GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE**:
   - **Reason**: Storage is centrally located, allowing you to quickly move to other areas if needed. It's also a common area for crewmates to pass through, giving you more opportunities for kills or alibis.

8. **Create an Alibi**:
   - **Action**: If you encounter other players, act as if you are doing tasks or moving between tasks.
   - **Reason**: This will help you avoid suspicion and blend in with the crewmates.

9. **Repeat the Process**:
   - **Action**: Continue moving between rooms, gathering information, sabotaging systems, and killing isolated crewmates.
   - **Reason**: This systematic approach will help you methodically eliminate crewmates while avoiding detection.

### Summary:
- **Primary Goal**: Kill all crewmates.
- **Key Actions**: Move strategically, gather information, sabotage systems, kill isolated crewmates, and create alibis.
- **Locations to Focus On**: Admin, Communications, Shields, and Storage.

By following this plan, you can systematically eliminate crewmates while minimizing the risk of being caught.
