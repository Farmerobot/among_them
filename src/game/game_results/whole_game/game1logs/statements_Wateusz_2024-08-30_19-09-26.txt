I understand Warcin's point about keeping an eye on different areas, but we need to focus on completing tasks to win. I didn't see Warcin completing any tasks, which is concerning. We should keep an eye on him, but also not rule out the possibility that the impostor is blending in by doing tasks. Let's stay vigilant and make sure we're all contributing to task completion.
