I agree with everyone that Warcin's movements seem suspicious. He was moving around a lot without completing tasks, which doesn't help us win. However, we should also consider Warek's movements. He moved from admin to storage, and I didn't see him completing any tasks there. Let's stay vigilant and make sure we're all contributing to task completion.
