\textbf{Wateusz}: I saw Waciej doing tasks in both the cafeteria and medbay, and he moved to the reactor and electrical after that. He seems to be doing his tasks.
\textbf{Waciej}: Thanks, Wateusz. I did see you doing tasks in the cafeteria and medbay as well. I also saw Warcin moving around a lot, from medbay to upper engine, then to lower engine, reactor, and finally electrical. That seems like a lot of movement without completing tasks. What were you up to, Warcin?
\textbf{Wikolaj}: I saw Wateusz and Waciej doing tasks in the cafeteria, so I can vouch for them there. However, I didn't see Warcin doing any tasks, just moving around a lot. That does seem suspicious.
\textbf{Warcin}: I was moving around to check on everyone and make sure no one was acting suspiciously. I did see Warek doing tasks in electrical before I left. It's important to keep an eye on different areas, especially since we need to find the impostor.
\textbf{Wateusz}: I agree with Waciej and Wikolaj. Warcin's movements do seem a bit erratic without any clear task completions. It's important to focus on tasks to win, and I didn't see Warcin completing any. We should keep an eye on him.
\textbf{Waciej}: I agree with Wateusz and Wikolaj. Warcin's movements do seem suspicious, especially since I didn't see him completing any tasks. We need to focus on those who aren't contributing to our progress. Let's keep an eye on Warcin for now.
\textbf{Wikolaj}: I agree with everyone that Warcin's movements seem suspicious. He was moving around a lot without completing tasks, which doesn't help us win. We should definitely keep an eye on him.
\textbf{Warcin}: I understand why my movements might seem suspicious, but I was genuinely trying to keep an eye on different areas to ensure no one was acting out of line. I did see Warek doing tasks in electrical before I left, and I didn't see anything unusual there. We should also consider that the impostor might be someone who is blending in by doing tasks. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly.
\textbf{Wateusz}: I understand Warcin's point about keeping an eye on different areas, but we need to focus on completing tasks to win. I didn't see Warcin completing any tasks, which is concerning. We should keep an eye on him, but also not rule out the possibility that the impostor is blending in by doing tasks. Let's stay vigilant and make sure we're all contributing to task completion.
