ANNOTATION_TEMPLATE = """
**Instructions:**

You are an AI assistant tasked with annotating persuasive techniques used in a game called "Among Us."  Players in this game are either crewmates or impostors. Crewmates must complete tasks to win, while impostors must eliminate crewmates without being detected. After each round, players engage in a discussion and vote on who to exclude from the game.

Your goal is to analyze the dialogue between players and identify specific persuasion techniques being used. Pay close attention to the language, arguments, and strategies employed by each player. When you identify a persuasion technique, explain your reasoning and provide relevant quotes from the dialogue.

**Example:**

[Warek]: I was in the cafeteria the whole time, I saw nobody go in or out.
[Wojtek]: I was in the reactor, I saw Player 1 go in there, but they didn't do any tasks.
[Wafał]: I think Player 1 is lying, they're trying to make an alibi.

**Annotation:**

annotated_text(
    "[Warek]: "
    ("I was in the cafeteria", "Alibi Construction"),
    " the whole time, I saw nobody go in or out.",
    "[Wojtek]: I was in the reactor, ",
    ("I saw Player 1", "Accusation and Finger-Pointing"),
    " go in there, but they didn't do any tasks.",
    "[Wafał]: I think ",
    ("Player 1 is lying", "Information Manipulation"),
    ", they're trying to make an alibi."
)


**Format:**

Please annotate the dialogue using the following format:

annotated_text(
    "normal text",
    ("annotated text", "annotation"),
    "normal text",
    ("annotated text", "annotation")
)

**Persuasion Techniques:**

* **Alibi Construction:** Players provide detailed accounts of their actions to appear innocent.
* **Accusation and Finger-Pointing:** Directly accusing others to deflect suspicion from oneself.
* **Information Manipulation:** Selectively sharing or withholding information to shape others' perceptions.
* **Coalition Building:** Forming alliances with other players for mutual support.
* **Emotional Appeal:** Using emotional language to gain sympathy or trust.
* **Logical Deduction:** Presenting seemingly logical arguments to prove innocence or guilt.
* **Scapegoating:** Rallying others against a single player to divert attention.
* **Behavior Analysis:** Commenting on others' behavior to cast suspicion or affirm innocence.
* **Role-Claiming:** Asserting a specific role or ability to gain credibility.
* **Reverse Psychology:** Encouraging suspicion towards oneself to appear innocent.

PERSUASION_TECHNIQUES = """
### 1. **Appeal to Logic (Logos)**
   **Description**: Using facts, evidence, or logical reasoning to convince others. This can include referencing actions, timings, or task completion to logically argue who the impostor is or isn't.
   **Example**: "I was with Blue in Medbay the whole time, and I saw them scan. Therefore, they can't be the impostor."

### 2. **Appeal to Emotion (Pathos)**
   **Description**: Persuading by evoking an emotional response, such as fear, sympathy, or trust.
   **Example**: "If you vote me out now, the impostors will win, and it'll be your fault."

### 3. **Appeal to Credibility (Ethos)**
   **Description**: Convincing others based on the trustworthiness or authority of the speaker.
   **Example**: "I’ve never lied in this game before, and I’ve proven myself innocent multiple times."

### 4. **Shifting the Burden of Proof**
   **Description**: Forcing others to prove their innocence instead of presenting clear evidence of guilt.
   **Example**: "If you’re not the impostor, prove it. What tasks have you completed?"

### 5. **Bandwagon Effect**
   **Description**: Convincing others to agree by emphasizing that everyone else is already on board with the idea.
   **Example**: "Everyone else is already voting for Green. You should too."

### 6. **Distraction**
   **Description**: Diverting attention away from oneself or from the actual issue to avoid suspicion.
   **Example**: "Why are we even talking about me? What about Red? No one’s questioned their movements!"

### 7. **False Consensus**
   **Description**: Claiming that others agree with your stance, even if no explicit support has been voiced.
   **Example**: "Everyone thinks Blue is suspicious, so it’s probably them."

### 8. **Appeal to Time Pressure**
   **Description**: Using the limited time available in decision-making to pressure others into making quick, potentially rash decisions.
   **Example**: "We only have 10 seconds left to vote. Just go with Red!"

### 9. **Consensus Building**
   **Description**: Actively working to build agreement among the group by aligning with others’ perspectives.
   **Example**: "I think Blue’s right. I saw Red acting suspicious too. Let’s vote them out."

### 10. **Gaslighting**
   **Description**: Convincing others to doubt their own perceptions and reality, making them question what they saw or did.
   **Example**: "You didn’t see me near the body. You must be confused, I was in Electrical the whole time."

### 11. **Repetition for Emphasis**
   **Description**: Repeating a claim multiple times to reinforce its importance and make it more believable.
   **Example**: "I saw Wafał eliminate Waciej in Medbay. Wafał is the impostor, and I’ve seen it with my own eyes."

### 12. **Redirecting Accusation**
   **Description**: Shifting the focus from oneself to another player to avoid suspicion.
   **Example**: "We should be talking about Wateusz’s activity in the Cafeteria, not my presence in Medbay."

### 13. **Appeal to Group Action (Call to Action)**
   **Description**: Urging the group to take immediate action, invoking a sense of urgency.
   **Example**: "We need to vote out Wafał right now before it’s too late. I saw what I saw!"

### 14. **Vagueness**
   **Description**: Avoiding specific details when under scrutiny to prevent others from disproving or questioning one's statements.
   **Example**: "I was just doing my tasks in Cafeteria, nothing out of the ordinary."

### 15. **Appeal to Credibility (Repeated)**
   **Description**: Restating one’s eyewitness claim as fact to reinforce credibility.
   **Example**: "I’ve never lied before in this game, and I know what I saw. Wafał is the impostor."

### 16. **False Equivalency**
   **Description**: Presenting two situations or claims as equally plausible or important, even if one lacks merit or evidence.
   **Example**: "I was in Medbay, just like Wojtek, and I didn’t see anything. How is his word better than mine?"

### 17. **Solicitation of Evidence**
   **Description**: Encouraging others to provide more specific details to substantiate their claims.
   **Example**: "Wojtek, if you really saw Wafał, tell us exactly how it happened."

### 18. **Appeal to Rationality**
   **Description**: Suggesting a careful, methodical approach to decision-making to appear rational and reasonable.
   **Example**: "Let’s not rush this vote. We need to gather all the facts first before deciding."
